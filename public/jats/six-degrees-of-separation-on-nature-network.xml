degrees of messaging</ext-link>) talks about a study on Microsoft
Messenger chat users. Any random two Microsoft Messenger users (out of
about 240 million) could be connected two each other via an average of 6
users that have chatted with each other.</p>
<p>This study is just another confirmation of the

using common authorship for a paper as connector. The mean distance of
two random authors in the MEDLINE database was 4.6.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, you can almost expect the same connections
through joint authorship between two random Nature Network members. Now
if I could only find a tool that would help with that task. Not
everybody is a mathematician and can simply calculate his
