<p>Four weeks ago I
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/11/06/beyond-the-pdf-it-is-time-for-a-workshop/">wrote
about</ext-link> the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/">Beyond
the PDF</ext-link> workshop that is planned for January in San Diego.
The goal of the workshop is to identify a set of requirements, and a
group of willing participants to develop open source code to accelerate
scientific knowledge sharing. The
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://groups.google.com/group/beyond-the-pdf?pli=1">Google
Group</ext-link> for the workshop has already seen a lot of interesting
discussions. I have since had more time to think about my contribution
and decided to propose the following:</p>
<p><italic><italic>Evaluate the blogging software</italic></italic>
<bold><bold><italic><italic>WordPress</italic></italic></bold></bold>
<italic><italic>as a platform to author, review and publish scientific
manuscripts. Extend the <bold><bold>WordPress</bold></bold>
functionality for authors and citations.</italic></italic></p>
<sec id="blogging-beyond-the-pdf">
  <title>Blogging Beyond the PDF</title>
  <p>Wordpress is a very interesting candidate for this because of the
  following features:</p>
  <list list-type="order">
    <list-item>
      <p>WordPress is Open Source and can be easily modified and
      extended by Themes, Plugins, etc.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>WordPress is used by millions of users, a market much larger
      than the scientific software market. Many requirements for a
      scientific writing platform are not specific for scientific
      software.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>WordPress treats article writing as a workflow that includes
      collaborative writing, version control, and a document status.</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>Of course I’m not the first to think about WordPress in this
  context, the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://journal.code4lib.org/">Code4Lib
  journal</ext-link> and
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://knowledgeblog.org/">Knowledge
  Blog</ext-link> are just two examples. To get started, I installed
  WordPress and a number of interesting Plugins at a new
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://blogs.xartrials.org/">Blogging
  Beyond the PDF</ext-link> website. Phil Bourne has kindly provided
  material from a recent <italic><italic>PLoS Computational
  Biology</italic></italic>
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000976">paper</ext-link>
  for the workshop. I formatted a first version of this paper using
  WordPress and the result can be seen
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://blogs.xartrials.org/2010/12/05/the-mycobacterium-tuberculosis-drugome-and-its-polypharmacological-implications-2/">here</ext-link>.
  There are a lot of rough edges (several tables and most references are
  still missing), but to me this looks good enough considering this is
  the result of maybe 10 hours of the work. In the next six weeks I will
  continue to work on this example manuscript to get a better idea of
  the strengths and weaknesses of the WordPress platform. I also hope to
  learn more from the experience of others. My first impressions are
  below.</p>

  <p>The
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/co-authors-plus/">Co-Authors
  Plus</ext-link> Plugin enables multiple authors per article. Each
  author can be linked to an author page for displaying biographical
  info. WordPress could be extended to include additional info such as
  institution or past publications. Linking the WordPress user account
  to the unique author identifier
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</ext-link>,
  and describing the role of the author in the paper (e.g.
  <italic><italic>conceived and designed the
  experiments</italic></italic> or <italic><italic>analyzed the
  data</italic></italic>) would be particularly interesting. Plugins
  such as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://www.editflow.org/">Edit
  Flow</ext-link> can extend the workflow by adding custom status
  messages (e.g. <italic><italic>resubmission</italic></italic>),
  reviewer comments, and email notifications.</p>

<sec id="figures">
  <title>Figures</title>
  <p>Wordpress has good functionality to add figures to articles,
  including the option to add a caption or resize the figure. In
  addition, there is a good number of Plugins that help with the
  resizing, other manipulations and display of images.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="tables">
  <title>Tables</title>
  <p>Wordpress doesn’t do tables, but several Plugins add that
  functionality, including
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://tobias.baethge.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-table-reloaded-english/">WP-Table
  Reloaded</ext-link>. This Plugin adds some very interesting functions,
  including the option to export table data as CSV or XLS files. This
  makes it much easier to reuse these data, something that I
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611081800/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/30/why-cant-i-reuse-these-tables-and-figures/">find
  very useful</ext-link>.</p>

  Plugin is one of several plugins that adds footnotes to articles.
  Several Plugins integrate with reference managers such as CiteULike,
  but the functionality is still very limited compared to how most
  reference managers are integrated with Microsoft Word or LaTeX.</p>
