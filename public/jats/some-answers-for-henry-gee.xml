<sec id="1-what-is-your-blog-about">
  <title>1. What is your blog about?</title>
  <p>I am interested in how the internet is changing the way we publish
  and communicate science. I write from the perspective of someone that
  consumes and sometimes produces science. Journal publishers, science
  librarians, patients and others will look at this topic from a
  different angle. This blog started as <italic><italic>Publish or
  Perish 2.0</italic></italic>, but I later changed the name to
  Gobbledygook. Mainly because I liked the word.</p>

  <title>2. What will you never write about?</title>
  <p>Of course I don't know. But I hope that I will not have to write
  blog posts that are evaluated, measured and put on a resum√© similar to
  scientific papers now.</p>

  <title>3. Have you ever considered leaving science?</title>
  <p>As a medical doctor in a university hospital I spend part of the
  day treating patients. I very much like the combination, but sometimes
  it is very exhausting. And research, both basic and clinical research,
  can lead into many dead ends. I've been there more than once.</p>

  <title>4. What would you do instead?</title>
  <p>Start a Web 2.0 company. Become a professional chef. Not
  really.</p>

  <title>5. What do you think will science blogging be like in 5
  years?</title>
  <p>I wrote down some of my thoughts on this in the post

  blogging is the new email</ext-link>. Science blogging will be very
  common and at the same time very specialized. Some science bloggers
  will be able to make enough money to earn a living from it.</p>

  because of blogging?</title>
  <p>Many, many things. Most importantly, meeting a lot of very
  interesting people both online and in real life.</p>

  <title>9. What do your colleagues at work say about your
  blogging?</title>
  <p>Most of them don't know about my science blogging. The rest doesn't
  really care. I hope that will change in 5 years (see #5).</p>

  <title>10. How the heck do you have time to blog and do research at
  the same time?</title>
  <p>Only because blogging means something else to me and doesn't really
  count as work. I don't blog during work hours. And I blog for fun and
  not money.</p>

  <title>11. Extra credit: are you able to write an entry to your blog
  that takes the form of a poem about your research?</title>
  <p>There once was a doctor from Hannover,
  it was cancer he tried to uncover.
  Doing a mouse model was all the hype,
  but instead of a phenotype,
  all he got was a hangover.</p>
