<p>Zhiyong Lu recently published an excellent overview of the web tools
that are currently available to search the biomedical literature. The
article has also a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610131235/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/search/">companion
web page</ext-link> that allows user to filter for the features they are
interested in, and to report new tools.</p>
<p>The author describes 28 tools developed specifically for the
biomedical domain. The tools are grouped based on their most important
features into</p>
<list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
    <p>Ranking search results</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Clustering results into topics</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Extracting and displaying semantics and relations</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Improving search interface and retrieval experience</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>Zhiyong Lu works for the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI). NCBI developed and maintains PubMed, and this is
obviously the database to which the other tools are compared. Or looked
at this differently, the proliferation of tools in the four areas listed
above is an indication of the areas where PubMed is not very good at
(e.g. it returns search results not by relevance, but in chronological
order).</p>
<p>Instead of reviewing the article, I decided to do this in two parts.
I will write about my thoughts on the various tools next week to give
everybody time to look at this themselves. This is my delayed
contribution to the

received will go up Saturday next week.</p>
