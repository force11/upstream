<p>Friday afternoon discussions can be dangerous. Last Friday I talked
with
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://network.nature.com/people/UC0402CE6/profile">Heinz
Pampel</ext-link> from the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://oa.helmholtz.de/index.php?id=137">Helmholtz
Open Access Initiative</ext-link> via email about the upcoming
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://bibcamp.wordpress.com/">BibCamp
Hannover</ext-link> (a barcamp for librarians and others interested in
online science that will take place this weekend). I said that I was
looking for a solution to make the list of publications from our
institution more accessible – we currently store them in a regularly
updated
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.refworks.com/refshare/?site=047931198224000000%2F">RefWorks
database</ext-link>. Heinz not only told me that there is actually a
name for this kind of tool (Current Research Information System or
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.cris2010.org/">CIRS</ext-link>),
but also gave me some good links.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:152805/Simon_Porter.pdf">This
talk</ext-link> by Simon Porter from the University of Melbourne is for
example a very good introduction to the topic.</p>
<p>Heinz also suggested
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://bibapp.org/">BibApp</ext-link>,
a nice web-based tool for exactly this purpose written in the
<italic><italic>Ruby on Rails</italic></italic> programming language.
Because I am a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.mh-hannover.de/studien/en/">very
familiar with Ruby on Rails</ext-link>, I took a closer look.</p>

<p>In the end I spent a good deal of this weekend setting up
<italic><italic>BibApp</italic></italic>, importing all publications
from our institution since 2008 via
<italic><italic>Refworks</italic></italic>, starting to add researchers
and research groups and adjusting
<italic><italic>BibApp</italic></italic> to our needs (mainly changing
the layout to our institution style and starting to translate the
templates into German). <italic><italic>BibApp</italic></italic> is
already a fully working system and is telling me some interesting
things. This includes many interesting papers from our institution that
I didn't know about, but also that two researchers each have published
more than 150 papers in two years, and that my colleagues have published
6 papers in
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411168">Medical
Hypotheses</ext-link> since 2008. The technical aspects of setting up
<italic><italic>BibApp</italic></italic> are almost solved (it helps
that I run two other <italic><italic>Ruby on Rails</italic></italic>
applications at my institution), so now I have to convince our library
and administration that it's worth having (and maintaining) such a CRIS
tool.</p>

<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/04/17/improving-the-conduct-of-science">Two
weeks ago I wrote about the upper part of the figure</ext-link> (for a
<italic><italic>NSF</italic></italic> workshop that got postponed to
September because of the Volcano ash). As far as I can see, there is no
standard between funding agencies for grant reporting, and both DataCite
and ORCID are fairly new initiatives.</p>
<p>The CRIS can be used to facilitate access to institutional
repositories or primary research datasets.
<italic><italic>BibApp</italic></italic> supports the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue54/allinson-et-al/">SWORD</ext-link>
protocol for article deposition, and it automatically checks all papers
against the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">ROMEO</ext-link>
database of publisher copyright policies. A CRIS is a great discovery
tool and it can be further enhanced by integration with social
networking tools (e.g. with the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://blogs.nature.com/u6e5b2ce1/2010/04/28/coming-soon-all-new-nature-network">new
Nature Network</ext-link> or the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.mendeley.com/blog/press-release/announcing-mendeley-open-api/">Mendeley
API</ext-link> both announced a few days ago).</p>
<p>The main interest of administrations if of course evaluation of
research output. A CRIS can be used to do exactly that, and it has two
advantages: a) it can automate some of the processes that are currently
done manually by researchers (regularly collecting and reporting
information about grants and publications), and b) it is a great
platform to develop new tools for the evaluation of scientific output.
My institution currently evaluates using the <italic><italic>Impact
Factor</italic></italic> of the published papers, and takes first and
last authorship (and female authors) into consideration. A CRIS would
allow an institution to use similar tools as the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.plosone.org/static/almInfo.action">PLoS
Article-Level Metrics</ext-link> (usage data, citation data, usage by
social networking tools) instead of the <italic><italic>Impact
Factor</italic></italic>, and several projects are already trying some
of that, e.g. the German
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.dini.de/projekte/oa-statistik/english/">Open
Access Statistics</ext-link> project.</p>
<p>But the best thing about CRIS tools in general, and
<italic><italic>BibApp</italic></italic> in particular, is that they add
a lot of value for relatively little effort. Universities don't want to
(and can't) compete with large institutions or companies such as
scientific publishers. Because they basically just integrate the data
that are already available in an intelligent way (Mashup in Web 2.0
language), they require a reasonable effort to maintain. This will be
particularly true once the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032822/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</ext-link>
system of unique author identifiers is in place, because author
disambiguation is currently one of the most time-consuming aspects (even
though <italic><italic>BibApp</italic></italic> is pretty smart about
this). I'm looking forward to adapt
<italic><italic>BibApp</italic></italic> to the
<italic><italic>ORCID</italic></italic> prototype system that is planned
for this summer.</p>
