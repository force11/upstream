<p>Now that we have a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/03/15/reference-manager-overview">number
of online reference managers to choose from</ext-link>, I thought it
would be interesting to look at their popularity â€“ both in absolute
numbers of visitors and the in changes during the last 12 months. Online
tools such as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://www.compete.com/">Compete</ext-link>
allow everybody to do just that, and their basic functions are free to
use. I've picked <italic><italic>unique visitors</italic></italic>, but
there are of course other statistics to look at, including total number
of visits.</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</ext-link>
is the most popular online reference manager, and it is obvious that the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://www.springer-sbm.com/index.php?id=291&amp;backPID=13041&amp;L=0&amp;tx_tnc_news=4739&amp;cHash=56bfa6b56c">announcement
by Springer to sponsor them</ext-link> last August has helped their site
traffic. Only CiteULike and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://www.labmeeting.com/">Labmeeting</ext-link>
show a significant increase in unique visitors in the last 6 months.</p>
<p>The statistics are more complicated for tools that include both a
desktop client and online database
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</ext-link>,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</ext-link>,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</ext-link>)
and these numbers should be interpreted with caution. I've included
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://www.refworks.com/">RefWorks</ext-link>
in both graphs for better comparison. It is probably safe to say that
both Endnoteweb and the online version of Mendeley are not as popular as
the online only reference managers in the first graph. This could either
mean that online only tools are far more popular than desktop
applications (which I doubt) or that most references are still primarily
stored in desktop programs and not shared online. Something that Eva
Amsen already described last year
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://network.nature.com/people/eva/blog/2008/08/19/how-to-get-scientists-to-adopt-web-2-0-technologies">How
to get scientists to adopt web 2.0 technologies</ext-link>). To put
these numbers into perspective:
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053433/http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>
(the home of PubMed and other NCBI databases) sees about 2.5 million
unique visitors a month.</p>
