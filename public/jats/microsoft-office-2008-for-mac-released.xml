<p>January is an important month for Macintosh users.

Expo</ext-link> takes place every year in San Francisco and we usually
see a lot of new software and hardware. The
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092917/http://www.apple.com/macbookair/">MacBook
Air</ext-link> is a wonderful new subnotebook perfect for successful
scientists with many talks to give and enough money to spend.</p>
<p>But
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092917/http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/Office2008/default.mspx">Microsoft
Office 2008 for Mac</ext-link> is probably the most important new
product from a scientists perspective. If you live in the U.S., you can
buy Office right now, us international users will have to wait a few
weeks. Office 2008 runs natively (i.e. much faster) on Intel Macs, so
everybody with those newer Macs wants to upgrade for that reason alone.
Powerpoint and Excel are important, but Microsoft Word is the
application I use most of the time.</p>
<p>Microsoft Word 2008 has a new feature called
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092917/http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/11/14/road_to_mac_office_2008_word_08_vs_pages_3_0.html&amp;page=3">citations</ext-link>,
basically a simple reference manager. This feature first appeared in
Office 2007 for Windows. Citations integrates nicely with your Word
document, but can't handle the more sophisticated needs of a research
paper, e.g. automatic importing form online databases and dozens of
reference styles for all the journals you possibly want to submit
to.</p>
<p>Unfortunately you can't use the current version of
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092917/http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</ext-link>
with Microsoft Word 2008. Thomson Scientific (the Endnote publisher) is
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092917/http://www.endnote.com/support/en_wpchart_mac.asp">working</ext-link>
on a version for Microsoft Word 2008. The update is made more difficult
by the fact that support for Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) was
dropped in Office 2008. The alternative reference managers
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092917/http://www.sonnysoftware.com/">Bookends</ext-link>
and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092917/http://www.thirdstreetsoftware.com/">Sente</ext-link>
also currently don't work with Microsoft Word 2008.</p>
<p>Microsoft Word 2008 by default uses the new XML-based .docx format
introduced in Office 2007 for Windows. This format was originally not
supported by Nature, Science and other STM publishers (read

Nascent post for the reasons behind it). Nature is

able to accept</ext-link> Word 2007 (and Word 2008) files, but this
might not necessarily be true for other publishers.</p>
