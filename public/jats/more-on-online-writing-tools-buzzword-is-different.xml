is another web-based writing tool and last week was opened for new
users. Buzzword is different, because it is based on Adobe Flash, which
makes for a much nicer user interface.</p>
<p>As expected, Buzzword doesn't handle references as flexible as
Microsoft Word. But you can at least get similar functionality with
endnotes. I expect many small changes before version 1.0, most
importantly support for the Symbol font.</p>
<p>You should give Buzzword a try if online document sharing with a
slick user interface is important to you.</p>
