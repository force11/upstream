<p>Scholarly documents often need metadata that describe them: typically
author(s), title and location (DOI or URL), but possibly many other
things. For some metadata it makes sense to store them in the document
text, e.g. as is typically done for citations. The problem is that this
can make it hard to make the metadata machine-readable. The worst place
for metadata is of course outside of the document, and unfortunately
that it is the most common way of doing this. Two examples:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>Manuscript submission. Papers submitted to scholarly journals
    contain the metadata in the text, but authors are required to enter
    the information again into a webform. You can add metadata
    (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-001/word-help/add-property-information-to-a-document-HA010163766.aspx">property
    information</ext-link>) to Microsoft Word documents, but it seems
    that nobody is doing it.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>PDFs and image files. Even though we have at least one good
    standard with
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/12/22/just_doi_it/">XMP</ext-link>
    to store metadata in these documents, it is not a common practice.
    Information about these documents is therefore stored somewhere else
    and doesn’t automatically travel with them.</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>The best place for metadata is the document itself, and the metadata
should be stored in machine-readable format. Another requirement is
flexibility in what we can store, and we shouldn’t limit ourselves to a
predefined list. Pandoc for example allows only three attributes in the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html">title
block</ext-link>:</p>
<preformat>% title
% author(s) (separated by semicolons)
% date</preformat>
<p>For Scholarly Markdown we have another requirement: the metadata
should be writeable and readable by humans.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</ext-link>
is the perfect format for this. JSON is closely related to YAML (and is
in fact a subset of YAML 1.2), but YAML can also be written with
whitespace instead of curly braces. The static website generator Jekyll
- which I use to parse the markdown for this blog into HTML - uses YAML
at the beginning of markdown documents to store metadata, and we can
easily extend this functionality. Carl Boettinger posted a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/21/what-flavor-is-scholarly-markdown/#comment-945513935">comment</ext-link>
yesterday saying that YAML support is on the Pandoc development
roadmap.</p>
<p>Below is the YAML for (Ethan P. White, 2013), where I reposted a
paper written in markdown:</p>

<p>In JSON the same information would look like this (and Jekyll is able
to parse it, since JSON is a subset of YAML 1.2):</p>

<p>You can see that the author information required for manuscript
submission can easily be written in YAML (email addresses were removed
to protect privacy). JSON is also possible for people where this is a
better fit into their workflow, but it is more difficult to write for
humans because of the curly braces, and because all strings need to be
in double quotes.</p>
<p>Once the ORCID Registry
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://orcid.org/blog/2013/06/27/orcid-plans-launch-affiliation-module-using-isni-and-ringgold-organization">adds
affiliation</ext-link> information, we no longer need to provide email
and affiliation when submitting manuscripts. I have stored my own name,
orcid, email and affiliation in my site configuration file so that I
don’t have to provide this info for every blog post.</p>
<p>In this blog markdown files are currently only processed to HTML, and
I store the metadata in HTML <monospace>meta</monospace> tags in a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.monperrus.net/martin/accurate+bibliographic+metadata+and+google+scholar">format</ext-link>
used by many sites and services, including Google Scholar - look at the
source code of Ethan P. White et al. (2013) for an example. These
metadata are also understood by the Greycite service built by Phil Lord
and Lindsay Marshall (2012) that generates citation information for
weblinks, adding important metadata such as title, authors and
publication_date so that we can properly cite our blog post (Ethan P.
White, 2013).</p>
<p>And I use the metadata to link the author names to their ORCID
profile (if they have an ORCID) or email address, with the affiliation
visible when you hover over the name. My own name is linked to the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/about.html">About</ext-link>
page of this site, but with a little development effort I could
automatically add all my publications (and other works) in my ORCID
profile to that page.</p>
<p>Metadata are important, and Scholarly Markdown makes it easy to embed
them.</p>
<p><italic>Update 06/30/13: added JSON example to demonstrate the
differences to YAML, and to show that Jekyll also works with JSON (used
in this blog post, and tested with the examples above which produce
identical HTML output). Also added two references, using the embedded
HTML metadata and the Greycite service to generate citations in
bibtex.</italic></p>
