<p>Last Tuesday the <italic><italic>Archives of Internal
Medicine</italic></italic> released a study that analyzed the news
reporting about cancer in 8 large-readership newspapers and 5 national
magazines in the United States. The authors identified 2228
cancer-focused articles published between 2005-2007 and did a more
detailed analysis on a random sample of 436 (20%) articles.</p>
<p>20% of articles discussed cancer in general, 35% focused on breast
cancer, and 15% focused on prostate cancer. 32% of the articles focused
on survival and 8% focused on death and dying. 57% articles discussed
aggressive treatments, but only two articles exclusively discussed
end-of-life palliative care. Only 13% of articles reported that
aggressive treatment might fail to cure or extend life, and only 30% of
articles mentioned that cancer treatments can result in (sometimes
serious) adverse events.</p>

<p>Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States
and therefore cancer news coverage is relevant to many people. One
important finding of the study is the relative under-reporting of death
and dying and palliative care, despite the well-documented benefits for
patients and their families. The <bold><bold>Pallimed</bold></bold> blog

<p>I am not surprised by these findings, as they seem to reflect the
expectations of most cancer patients and their families towards
treatment. In my personal experience as a doctor treating cancer
patients, most patients, relatives and their treating physicians
(including myself) are overly optimistic about the potential benefits of
an aggressive cancer treatment (especially if part of a clinical trial),
and talk much less about the possibility of the treatment not working,
side effects, or death and dying. The scientific literature

<p>The study raises a number of additional questions:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>What scientific information was used as background information
    for the news reports? Conference reports vs. published papers, case
    reports vs. large randomized trials, research in animal models vs.
    clinical research? Was a source for the research provided in the
    news reports?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>What is the cancer news coverage by science/medical bloggers? Is
    there a similar bias towards aggressive treatment approaches and an
    under-reporting of treatment failures and adverse events?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Are there geographical differences (U.S. vs. Europe, urban vs.
    rural areas) in cancer news reporting and changes over time?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>How are other areas of science covered in the media, e.g. other
    common diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease or malaria, climate
    research or other reasearch areas with large public interest, or
    basic science research?</p>
