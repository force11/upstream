    <p>There’s a gap between science and technology, and it’s
    growing.</p>

<p>Eva argues that – contrary to popular belief – there is actually a
divide between science and technology. Scientists are on average not
really comfortable using technology, and many computing tools aimed for
scientists really miss the point of what scientists really care
about.</p>

    ultimate aim of making research more productive through the use of
    technology.</p>

<p>Initial products include the chemical text-mining tool

<p>As a big fan of using technology for science I am looking forward to
what Digital Science will do in the coming months. I am particularly
interested in their answer to the questions asked by Eva. Have they
found a better way to understand what technologies scientists really
want? Or are tools for digital science something that the majority of
scientists don’t really care about?</p>
