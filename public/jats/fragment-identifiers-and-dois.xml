<p>Before all our content turned digital, we already used
<bold><bold>page numbers</bold></bold> to describe a specific section of
a book or longer document, with older manuscripts using the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folio">folio</ext-link>
before that. Page numbers have transitioned to electronic books with
readers such as the Kindle
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/page-numbers-for-kindle-books-an-imperfect-solution/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">supporting
them eventually</ext-link>.</p>

<p>For content on the web we can use the <monospace>#</monospace>
fragment identifier, e.g.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier#Proposals">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier#Proposals</ext-link>
to navigate to a specific section of a web page. How the linking to this
fragment is handled, depends on the <bold><bold>MIME</bold></bold> type
of the document, and will for example be done differently for a text
page than a video - YouTube understands minutes and seconds into a video
as fragment identifier, e.g.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UNRZEsLxKc#t=54m52s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UNRZEsLxKc#t=54m52s</ext-link>.
Fragment identifiers are not only helpful to link to a subsection of a
document, but of course also for navigation within a document.</p>
<p>All this is of course very relevant to scholarly content, which is
usually much more structured, with most journal articles following the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMRAD">IMRAD</ext-link>
- introduction, methods, results, and discussion - format, usually with
additional sections such as abstract, references, etc. One approach to
link to figures and tables within a scholarly articles is using
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/direct-links-to-figures-and-tables-using-component-dois/">component
DOIs</ext-link>, e.g. specific DOIs for parts of a larger document. The
publisher <bold><bold>PLOS</bold></bold> has been using them for a long
time, and the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://martinfenner.ghost.io/2014/07/24/dont-reinvent-the-wheel/">number
of component DOIs is rising</ext-link>, but most scholarly journal
articles don’t use component DOIs. And whereas component DOIs are a
great concept for content such as figures (allowing us to describe the
MIME type and other relevant metadata), they are probably not the best
tool to link to a section or paragraph of a scholarly document.</p>
<p>As it turns out, we already have a tool for that, as the DOI proxy
server gracefully forwards fragment identifiers (how did I miss this?).
We can therefore use a DOI with a fragment identifier to</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>Results section:
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103437#s2">http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103437#s2</ext-link></p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Specific reference:
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.4263.1#ref-7">http://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.4263.1#ref-7</ext-link></p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Decision letter:
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00471#decision-letter">http://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00471#decision-letter</ext-link></p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>Obviously this only works if the DOI is resolved to the full-text of
a resource, and not a landing page. And how the fragment identifiers are
named and implemented is up to the publisher, and the DOI resolver has
no information about them. These specific links are particularly nice
for discussions of a paper, whether it is on Twitter or in a discussion
forum. It appears that at least the Twitter link shortener keeps the
fragment identifier, the link to the eLife decision letter is shortened
to
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://t.co/URWaYmGHnY">http://t.co/URWaYmGHnY</ext-link>.
This kind of linking works particularly well if the publisher is using a
fine-grained system of fragment identifiers, the publisher PeerJ for
example allows links to a specific paragraph - e.g.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.500#p-15">http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.500#p-15</ext-link>
- and allows users to
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blog.peerj.com/post/62886292466/peerj-questions-a-new-way-to-never-publish-forget">ask
a question</ext-link> right next to that section.</p>
<p>The examples above all use MIME type
<monospace>text/html</monospace>, as this is what the example DOIs
resolve to by default. I don’t if and how publishers have implemented
fragment identifiers for other formats such as PDF or ePub, and what
happens if you combine fragment identifiers with
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crosscite.org/cn/">content
negotiation</ext-link>. The shortDOI service works with fragment
identifiers as well:
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/pxd#decision-letter">http://doi.org/pxd#decision-letter</ext-link>.
Another interesting question would be how fragment identifiers are
handled for datasets. Typically separate DOIs are assigned for multiple
related datasets, but there could also be a place for fragment
identifiers as well, e.g. to specify a subset via a date range. The
solution depends again on the content type, and the popular
<monospace>text/csv</monospace> is unfortunately not well suited for
this, whereas JSON – using
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901">JSON
Pointer</ext-link> – would work well.</p>
<p><italic>Update 8/2/14:
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://twitter.com/ldodds">Leigh
Dodds</ext-link> points out that handling the fragment identifier is up
to the client and the fragment identifier is not sent to the server.
Acrobat reader for example supports the <monospace>#page=</monospace>
fragment identifier. He also mentions that there is a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7111">RFC7111</ext-link>
for fragment identifiers for the text/csv media type - browsers in the
future might support something like
<monospace>http://example.com/data.csv#row=5-7</monospace>.</italic></p>
