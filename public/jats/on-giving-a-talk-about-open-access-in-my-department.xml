<p>Earlier this month I gave this talk in my department. It is basically
a summary of two blog posts that I wrote in October during
<bold><bold>Open Access Week</bold></bold> (Open Access Week: a
researcher's perspective
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/18/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective">part
I</ext-link> and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/23/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective-part-ii">part
II</ext-link>), and I had given a similar talk in November in an
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://oa.helmholtz.de/index.php?id=254">Open
Access workshop</ext-link> organized by the Helmholtz Association. But
because this time my audience (researchers and clinicians in a
university hospital) was less knowledgeable about Open Access, I added a
few introductory slides in the beginning.</p>
<p>The discussion is usually the most interesting part, and this topic
certainly has a lot of material for discussion. Interestingly, we talked
mainly about the problem of <bold><bold>copyright</bold></bold>. Even
though anybody who has ever submitted a paper to a (non-Open Access)
journal has signed a copyright transfer agreement, the implications of
this were not really clear to most people in the audience. Reuse of a
figure or table in an academic seminar usually falls under
<bold><bold>fair use</bold></bold>, but many journals still require a
(free)
permission.<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/12/13/on_giving_a_talk_about_open_access_in_my_department/#fn1">1</ext-link></sup>
And using the same figure in a medical conference can cost several
hundred dollars, and it doesn't really matter that you are one of the
authors of the paper (slides 15-17 in the presentation). Some of my
colleagues have run into issues with copyright, usually when the talks
of a conference were later redistributed on a CD or website.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there wasn't enough time to discuss some of the other
issues raised in the talk, e.g.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>Why can't our Medical School Library afford an institutional
    subscription for <italic><italic>Cell</italic></italic>?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Why is there no <bold><bold>institutional
    repository</bold></bold> at our university?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Why is it very unlikely that we will have a mandate for Open
    Access in Germany in the near future?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Why has the <bold><bold>Impact Factor</bold></bold> become so
    important in Medicine?</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>The seminar was also interesting in that this was one of the rare
occasions where I talked publicly in my department about some of the
topics that I regularly write about on this blog. I always felt that
most of my colleagues don't really care about these topics, and that
they probably think I should rather spend my time working on the next
paper or grant. I haven't gotten much feedback after the talk, but maybe
I should reconsider that position.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Many journals use
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065053/http://www.copyright.com/">Copyright.com</ext-link>,
which makes this process straightforward.</p>
