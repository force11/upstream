<p><italic><italic>Ben Goldacre: Bad Science. Published September 2008
by Fourth Estate Ltd. Paperback, 352 pages, ISBN

Goldacre</ext-link>, blogger of the <italic><italic>Bad
Science</italic></italic>[1] column in the Guardian newspaper, in
September published a book based on material from his blog. Just like
the newspaper column, the book is primarily intended for a general
audience rather than the trained scientist or medical doctor. And it
helps to live in Great Britain, where most of the examples of bad
science given in the book happened.</p>
<p>But the book is not really a collection of scary and sometimes
hilarious bad science stories. Ben Goldacre takes these examples and
tries to teach the reader evidence-based medicine. Evidence-based
medicine<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174108/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/24/book_review_bad_science_by_ben_goldacre/#fn2">2</ext-link></sup>
or EBM uses the scientific method to make decisions about the care of
individual patients. It is funny how many people – including medical
doctors – throw away all the research evidence that is available and
instead rely on personal experiences. And evidence-based medicine helps
to distinguish good research from bad research, e.g. by stressing the
importance of randomized controlled trials. The book was very
stimulating reading for me, including the chapter about the placebo
effect<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174108/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/24/book_review_bad_science_by_ben_goldacre/#fn3">3</ext-link></sup>.
But I'm a medical doctor, and I don't know whether Ben Goldacre
succeeded in every reader with this teaching mission. Even so, most
readers will look much more carefully at science stories in the media
after finishing the book. And that is a good thing.</p>
