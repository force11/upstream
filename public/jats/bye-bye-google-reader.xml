<p>Yesterday Google announced that they will
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731151455/http://googleblog.blogspot.de/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">shut
down Google Reader</ext-link> July 1st. In a way this announcement
didn’t surprise me, as my own use of RSS readers has gone down in favor
of news readers such as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731151455/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/05/flipboard-plos-blogs-on-the-ipad/">Flipboard</ext-link>
and using Twitter as a discovery tool. And built-in support for RSS had
slowly been depreciated in web browsers such as Firefox (version 4,
2011) and Safari (version 6, 2012).</p>
<p>Although RSS (and the related Atom) may never have caught on with the
typical web user, it is an essential tool for scholarly content. It is
the best format to subscribe to journal table of contents, much more
suitable than email alerts.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731151455/http://www.journaltocs.ac.uk/">JournalTOCs</ext-link>
is a good place to get started, but most publishers prominently display
the RSS icon. RSS is also great for searches you want to do regularly
and is supported by PLOS,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731151455/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/disted/pubmedtutorial/040_060.html">PubMed</ext-link>,
and others. Because it is a machine-readable format, it is also used by
many websites to automatically read in article information. RSS feeds
for journal table of contents differ in format, but CrossRef in 2009 has
posted
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731151455/http://oxford.crossref.org/best_practice/rss/">recommendations</ext-link>
for publishers.</p>
<p>Google Reader is of course only one of many RSS readers, so this
announcement shouldn’t have any immediate impact. Nevertheless it is
probably another sign that the web is moving away from RSS, and that we
should start to think about alternatives for distributing tables of
content. Or that we should use different strategies for finding
interesting articles that have recently been published, e.g. follow the
article recommendations in your social network.</p>
