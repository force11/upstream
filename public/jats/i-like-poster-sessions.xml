sessions at the just finished
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092256/http://www.asco.org/">American
Society of Clinical Oncology</ext-link> meeting didn't offer food and
drink, but were otherwise very enjoyable. The meeting is probably
special because a lot of high quality research will be presented as
poster, as there is just not enough time for enough oral sessions. Many
of the poster presenters were senior faculty. I also like the printouts
that were available from most posters â€“ but there still was a lot of
picture taking with digital cameras. A very good feature was the oral
summary of some of the poster sessions: 15 minute presentations of 5-10
posters, summarized and commented on by an expert in the field.</p>
<p>I had some very informative discussions with a number of poster
presenters. When you are familiar with the research topic it is often
possible to go straight to the interesting issues, the nonlinear and
interactive format of a poster is then often better than an oral
presentation. The downside of a poster presentation is obviously that
the format is good for presenting to a small audience only. But the
poster presenter will usually get much more feedback than from an oral
presentation.</p>
