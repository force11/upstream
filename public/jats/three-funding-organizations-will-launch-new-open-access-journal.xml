    <p>The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Max Planck Society and
    the Wellcome Trust announced today that they are to support a new,
    top-tier, open access journal for biomedical and life sciences
    research.</p>

<p>Some features of the new journal:</p>

<p>This is an important announcement, as the journal has the potential
to have a major impact on publishing biomedical research. Two aspects of
the announcement surprise me: many details about the new journal have
not been decided, I would have expected at least a decision about the
journal name and Editor-in-Chief. And from the few details in the
announcement the new journal appears to take a fairly conservative
approach to publishing. You could for example compare today’s press
release with the editorial explaining the launch of PLoS Biology from
October 2003
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611031434/http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0000036">Why
PLoS became a Publisher</ext-link>). This approach is understandable as
most scientists are conservative and don’t care much about new
publishing technologies or even open access; they only care about having
their research accepted in a journal with high impact. Publishing this
kind of journal – which usually means high rejection rates and
time-consuming editorial work – is difficult with with an author-pays
business model. The deep pockets of the three funding organizations
change this equation.</p>
<p>Earlier this year we saw the the announcements of

ONE and the Rise of the Open Access Mega Journal</ext-link>). The new
journal announced today takes a very different approach to open access
publishing.</p>
<p>This announcement has of course also been discussed elsewhere,
