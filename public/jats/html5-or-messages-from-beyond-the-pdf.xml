<p>In 1990 Tim Berners-Lee and others started HTML and the world wide
web to facilitate scientific communications at CERN, the worldâ€™s largest
particle physics laboratory.</p>

<p>Although the world wide web profoundly changed scholarly publishing
(and of course many other things), HTML did not become the standard
document format for scientific papers. In fact, there is no standard
document format. We have document formats for authors, for the internal
workflow of publishers, and for the distribution and reading of
papers.</p>
<p>There are of course many good reasons to use LaTeX for writing, XML
for workflows, PDF to print papers or ePub for mobile devices. But
reformatting a manuscript into different formats several times is both
expensive (in terms of time and costs) and means that the formatting
options used will be a compromise of what is available in all
formats.</p>

<p>All this would be much easier if we just used HTML. With HTML,
authors, publishers and readers can all use the same document format.
And they will have an endless number of tools at their hands, including
of course

for writing and the web browser of choice for reading. HTML in 2010 is
very different from HTML in 1990. HTML5 supports new semantic elements
such as &lt;article&gt;, microdata, embedding of video without plugins,
geolocation, and offline web applications.</p>
<p>An HTML-based scholarly publishing workflow will make it</p>
