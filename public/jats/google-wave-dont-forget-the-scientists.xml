Wave</ext-link> is a new tool to communicate online and collaborate and
was announced today at the

I/O</ext-link> conference. Google Wave is not only a product, but also
an open protocol that anyone can use to build his own wave server.</p>
<p>Google Wave is already very interesting by itself, but can also be
extended further:</p>

    tasks and run on the server, and</p>

  <list-item>
    <p>by <italic><italic>gadgets</italic></italic> that allow new ways
    of user interactions and run on the client.</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>This sounds all rather geeky, but why should a scientist care about
<italic><italic>Google Wave</italic></italic>? Part of the job of every
scientist is to communicate and collaborate, and email is by far the
most widely used tool to do that. Email has many shortcomings, some of
which can be overcome by blogs, wikis, and a constantly growing number
of other Web 2.0 tools from Twitter to FriendFeed. But Google Wave goes
one step further. The basic idea of a wave is a document (and this can
be everything from text to pictures) combined with the discussion about
that document, and that is a very natural design for many scientific
communications.</p>
<p>Google Wave will be publicly available later this year. I hope that
by that time it will also have the first extensions designed
specifically for scientists, e.g. for</p>
