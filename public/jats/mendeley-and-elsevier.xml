<p>Earlier this week the rumors that started in January became official:
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blog.mendeley.com/start-up-life/team-mendeley-is-joining-elsevier/">Elsevier
is buying Mendeley</ext-link> (see also

A

has been written</ext-link> about this announcement, in particular about
the fear that Mendeley as a product and organization will turn into
something not as open and collaborative as before.</p>
<p>I first met Victor and Jan from Mendeley in 2008 and did an
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/09/05/interview_with_victor_henning_from_mendeley/">interview
with Victor</ext-link> in September 2008. We worked together in the
organization of two
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science
Online London conferences</ext-link> (2009 and 2010, together with
Nature.com and others), and my current job started with an entry for an
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blog.mendeley.com/design-research-tools/winners-of-the-first-binary-battle-apps-for-science-contest/">API
programming contest</ext-link> co-organized by PLOS and Mendeley, with
the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/09/28/announcing-sciencecard/">first
lines of code written</ext-link> in the Mendeley offices during the
Science Online London 2011 hackathon. I wish Mendeley all the best with
their new parent.</p>
<p>What this acquisition signals to me is that commercial publishers are
now moving into the software tools for scientists business at full
speed. They have always done this, but with
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.readcube.com/">ReadCube</ext-link>
by Digital Science (a Nature Publishing Group sister company) in 2011,
the acquisition of
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.papersapp.com/">Papers</ext-link>
by Springer last year and now Mendeley, reference management now often
means using a tool owned by a publisher â€“ this market used to be
dominated academic software such as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</ext-link>
and commercial software vendors such as Thomson Reuters
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://endnote.com/">Endnote</ext-link>)
or ProQuest
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044726/http://www.refworks.com/">RefWorks</ext-link>).</p>
<p>For me this trend signals that publishers have realized that we are
moving into an Open Access publishing model, which in contrast to
subscription publishing is not about owning the content, but about
providing valuable services around content that is free to read and
reuse.</p>
