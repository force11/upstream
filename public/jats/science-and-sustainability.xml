<p>Sustainability in science is nothing new. The term sustainability
science was probably first used in 2001 (see
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability_science">Wikipedia

in <italic><italic>Science</italic></italic>. There are both journals

in sustainability science. The term sustainability is usually used in
the context of climate change and the conservation of natural
resources.</p>
<p>Here I want to use sustainability in a broader sense, using the
original definition: <italic><italic>able to be maintained at a certain
rate or
level</italic></italic>.<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/12/27/science_and_sustainability/#fn1">1</ext-link></sup>
Examples where the way we currently do science will probably no longer
be sustainable in the future include grant applications that have a
chance of success as low as 1%
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://blogs.nature.com/peer-to-peer/2009/08/the_wait_continues_for_nih_cha.html">the

without any increase in approval for new drugs in the last 60 years
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2009/12/09/drug_companies_since_1950.php">Drug

<p>Sustainability in science requires the individual researcher to think
about his responsibility, i.e. to go beyond research that is personally
interesting and is paid for by someone. I do think that increasing
sustainability in science is a worthy goal, and I picked six
examples.</p>
<sec id="make-access-to-research-results-affordable">
  <title>Make access to research results affordable</title>
  <p>For those not working at an academic institution, many
  subscription-based journals now make their papers available after a
  6-12 month embargo period. Immediate full access to an individual
  paper in these journals can cost anywhere between $10 and $30 ($31.50
  Cell, $15.00 Science, $32.00 Nature, $31.50 The Lancet, $10 New
  England Journal of Medicine). As you can guess from the wide range for
  these journals alone, these prizes are probably not calculated to
  cover actual costs. Deep Dyve

  a rental service for scientific content</ext-link> in October. They
  charge $0.99 per article rental, but currently include only a limited
  number of journals.</p>
  <p>Most researchers have access to subscription-based journals through
  their institutions. My university library currently has a
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://dx.doi.org/10.3205/mbi000161">budget</ext-link>
  of about 900,000 â‚¬ per year for just over 2000 researchers and 2600
  students. Even with this money, our institution
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/18/open-access-week-a-researchers-perspective">can't
  afford subscriptions to all journals</ext-link> import for my work.
  And subscription costs are increasing much faster than library
  budgets.
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/12/13/on-giving-a-talk-about-open-access-in-my-department">Open
  Access</ext-link> obviously is one answer to this dilemma, but
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat2497">may
  not work for all journals</ext-link>. Most of us would probably be
  happy to pay for journal subscriptions if subscription costs simply
  remained reasonable. Because a handful of publishers own a large part
  of scientific journals, this will only happen if someone representing
  a large group of universities and research institutions sits at the
  negotiation table.</p>

<sec id="reduce-the-bureaucracy-in-science-funding">
  <title>Reduce the bureaucracy in science funding</title>
  <p>We are currently spending too much time trying to obtain research
  funding compared to the time actually doing research. This is in part
  because the chances of obtaining a grant are often fairly low and
  grant applications have to be submitted many times, and because the
  duration of some grants is to short, e.g. only 2-3 years (sometimes
  meaning you have to start writing on the extension grant after the
  first year). Providing funding to excellent researchers for longer
  periods of time instead of funding projects is one approach to improve
  this situation. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute has done this for
  many years with
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.hhmi.org/research/investigators/">HHMI
  investigators</ext-link> and the Wellcome Trust last month announced a
  similar approach with

  Trust Investigator Awards</ext-link>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="communicate-and-use-research-results">
  <title>Communicate and use research results</title>
  <p>A lot of research has practical value, but this practical value has
  to be explored. One nice example from my area of expertise is an
  international consortium to improve the outcome of a specific form of
  acute leukemia in the developing world. The first results
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://www.hematology.org/Publications/ASH-News-Daily/2009/4636.aspx">were
  reported</ext-link> at the ASH meeting earlier this month, one of only
  a handful of abstracts to be picked for the plenary session. But use
  of research results goes beyond translational research, using them for
  science education (both in schools and universities) is equally
  important.</p>
  <p>Science blogging could have an important role in communicating
  research, and
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002031738/http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2009/12/story-behind-nature-paper-on-phylogeny.html">this

  It would be great if more journals would follow the
  <italic><italic>PLoS</italic></italic> journals in linking to blogs

  and journals should help their authors to blog, e.g. by asking for a
  blog post (that could be hosted by the journal) on paper acceptance.
  Conference blogging is another area where science blogging would be a
  very welcome addition. It was nice to see

  <title>Preserve research data</title>
  <p>Providing and preserving the research data behind a project is

  In many areas we lack the infrastructure (nomenclature, databases,
  etc.) and resources for this, especially for long-term preservation.
  One ambitious project is

  active role in healthcare decisions.</p>
  <p>Whether sustainability will ultimately play a greater role in
  science will ultimately depend on those paying for research. If
  universities, institutions and funders continue to look mainly at
  goals that are both too short-term and only an indirect measure of
  scientific progress (e.g. the Impact Factor of a journal that a paper
  is published in), and don't honor activities such as data annotation,
  public outreach, etc., this will be very difficult. I wish you a great
  start into the new year.</p>
