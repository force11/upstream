<p>It has become common practice to make presentation slides available
for those unable to attend in person, or for more in-depth review later.
The most popular service to do this is of course
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404225654/http://www.slideshare.net/">Slideshare</ext-link>.
Slideshare is a fine service, but the website has become fairly
cluttered over the years, and visuals are of course important when it
comes to presentations.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404225654/http://speakerdeck.com/">Speaker
Deck</ext-link> is an alternative to Slideshare with a focus on
“simplicity and beauty”. The service has the features you would
expect:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>upload presentations (currently in PDF only)</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>view presentations, including fullscreen mode</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>share presentations, including downloads and embedding</p>
  </list-item>
</list>

<p>Speaker Deck was
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404225654/http://orderedlist.com/blog/articles/share-presentations-without-the-mess/">announced
last September</ext-link> and is free to use. It would be helpful if
Speaker Deck allowed the upload of Powerpoint or Keynote files, making
it easier to reuse the slides. But the big item on my wish list is an
improvement of the social activities enabled around a presentation. I
want to see download counts, comments, number of tweets and Facebook
likes, and I want an API for them. Ordered List, the company behind
Speakerdeck, was
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160404225654/http://orderedlist.com/blog/articles/ordered-list-acquired-by-github/">acquired
by Github</ext-link> in December, turning Speaker Deck into a Github
product. This makes me confident that we will see these Speaker Deck
improvements rather sooner than later.</p>
