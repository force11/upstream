<p>Last week I attended the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://research.microsoft.com/en-US/events/escience2011-scholarly-communications/default.aspx">Transforming
Scholarly Communication</ext-link> workshop in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
The main goal of the workshop was to come up with practical
recommendations for the topics

    <p>This workshop strives to be different in one important way—rather
    than focusing on utopian visions for their own sake, we will focus
    on the existing and newly developed technologies designed to enhance
    scholarship and scholarly communication in order to determine
    factors for their success and their potential.</p>

<p>The workshop started with product demos (18 demos in a little over
three hours!), we then spent two half days working in smaller groups on
one of the six topics above. I was assigned to the
<bold><bold>#recognition</bold></bold> group, and we started with a very
open discussion about recognition, reputation, altmetrics and related
topics. The work was much more focussed on the second day, where we
produced a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://msrworkshop.tumblr.com/tagged/recognition">draft
text</ext-link> with practical recommendations.</p>
<p>We all reported back to the whole group in the plenary discussion the
second day, but unfortunately didn’t have much time (and energy) left to
discuss the reports of the other topic groups in more detail. It was
suggested that we create a Wikipedia page summarizing our reports, so
that researchers interested in new scholarly communication tools would
have a starting point.</p>
<p>I personally felt that most reports (including our own) had too much
detail information – they are great resources of information, but are
probably overwhelming for the average researcher. I therefore thought
that a good alternative to a wiki page would be a Question &amp; Answer
site similar to the hugely popular
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack
Overflow</ext-link> and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://www.quora.com/">Quora</ext-link>.
Even simpler would be a book in the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://shop.oreilly.com/category/series/cookbooks.do">Cookbook</ext-link>
or
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120856/http://pragprog.com/book/fr_arr/advanced-rails-recipes">Recipes</ext-link>
format so popular with programmers. The book would be a collection of
solutions for many of the small problems we face in scholarly
communication today. We probably need hundreds of recipes, to start this
off I today wrote a

for creating a researcher profile page</ext-link> (very much based on
our topic report).</p>
