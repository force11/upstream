  <title>Most journals allow posting post-prints on a university
  website</title>
  <p>The copyright agreement with the journal is the easy part. Most
  publishers allow posting of post-prints (after peer-review, but not
  the journal PDF) in a non-commercial repository, usually the
  repository of your institution. Below are the policies of three
  prominent publishers.</p>

  is a directory of open access repositories. My university doesn't yet
  have an institutional repository. After a short email exchange they
  offered to host my post-prints on a public webserver. I currently have
  no details on the software platform used or how many people in my
  university use this service.</p>

  <title>Post-prints may no longer be available</title>
  <p>Most publishers don't allow posting of the journal PDF. You have to
  post the final manuscript after per-review (post-print). The problem:
  I no longer have these manuscripts for papers published more than a
  few years ago – thinking that the PDF would be enough.</p>

  <title>Your post-prints are hard to find</title>

  has a search function, but searching several institutional
  repositories at once is complicated. Your best bet is probably to find
  a paper in
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110637/http://www.pubmed.gov/">Pubmed</ext-link>
  and then try to find the institutional repository for that author. But
  maybe you have to check several institutional repositories if the
  authors are not all from the same institution.</p>

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>Posting your paper in an institutional repository can be a
  challenging project. It is therefore advisable to think about this
  before paper submission. What is your publication strategy? Do you
  need open access? Does the journal offer free content after an embargo
  period of 6 or 12 months? What is the journal policy regarding
  post-prints? And most importantly, keep the manuscript version right
  after peer-review. A central repository such as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110637/http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/">Pubmed
  Central</ext-link> doesn't have most of these shortcomings.</p>
