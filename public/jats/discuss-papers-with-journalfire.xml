<p>About a year ago I wrote a blog post about how to use Web 2.0 tools
for a journal club
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/08/08/recipe-distributing-papers-for-a-journal-club">Recipe:
Distributing papers for a journal club</ext-link>). Although reference
management tools such as <italic><italic>CiteULike</italic></italic> and
<italic><italic>Mendeley</italic></italic> can be used for journal
clubs, discussion features are often more of an afterthought. At the
time I therefore recommended FriendFeed. In February of this year,
ScienceFeed was released
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103044/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/02/15/sciencefeed-interview-with-ijad-madisch">ScienceFeed:
Interview with Ijad Madisch</ext-link>). It is very similar to
FriendFeed, but is smarter about finding and storing references to
scientific literature. Unfortunately ScienceFeed integrates very tightly
with ResearchGate. You have to sign up for both services to use the
reference management features.</p>
<p>Last week a new web-based tool specifically for Journal Clubs was
released.

Hill</ext-link>. JournalFire is free for public discussion groups, but
costs money for private groups with more than 4 members.</p>

<p>Feel free to participate in the discussion about this article

I've picked a paper that is not only freely available and nicely
written, but also in a very hot field.</p>
<sec id="what-i-like">

  <p>JournalFire really focuses on discussion around a paper. Journal
  Clubs are used to organize the discussion, similar to groups in other
  tools. The interface is uncluttered, and almost everything is
  available as RSS feed.</p>

  <p>JournalFire was just released publicly, so it obviously doesn't
  have all the features of a more mature product. More importantly,
  JournalFire covers a fairly specific reference management niche, it is
  therefore important that data exchange with other reference management
  tools is as easy as possible.
  JournalFire has a bookmarklet similar to what other reference managers
  offer, and you can export one or more references in Endnote or BibTex
  format.

  support should be an obvious addition, and an API would allow tighter
  integration with other tools, e.g. to add Journal Club features to
  your CiteULike, Mendeley or Zotero library.</p>
  <p>The Journal Club concept of JournalFire fills a very interesting
  niche. But in the end, social tools for scientists are about critical
  mass. It will be interesting to see whether JournalFire can attract
  enough users in this very crowded market.</p>
