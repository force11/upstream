<p>Elsevier on Saturday launched
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201220/http://info.sciverse.com/">SciVerse</ext-link>,
the new Elsevier platform that combines
<italic><italic>ScienceDirect</italic></italic> (full-text journal
articles) and <italic><italic>Scopus</italic></italic> (abstract and
citation database of peer-reviewed literature). In 2011
<italic><italic>SciTopics</italic></italic> (research summaries) will
also be integrated and outside developers will be able to build SciVerse
<italic><italic>applications</italic></italic> (Elsevier and 3rd party
tools that integrate with ScienceDirect and Scopus). Current users of
Scopus and ScienceDirect can continue to use these services or access
them from the SciVerse platform.</p>

<p>Both the ScienceDirect and Scopus service are not available this
evening, put the new SciVerse functionality should be available in a few
hours. As I had no access to SciVerse prior to the launch today, I will
need a few days to have a closer look at both the integration of
existing products, and the new features. But obviously missing from the
announcement is
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201220/http://www.2collab.com/">2collab</ext-link>,
Elsevier's social bookmarking service that integrates with Scopus and
ScienceDirect.</p>
<p>Reference managers a few years ago started to store the PDFs of
fulltext articles associated with a citation. It is no surprise to see
the same trend from developers of abstracts databases. The integration
of Scopus with ScienceDirect almost looks like Elsevier's answer to
PubMed/PubMed Central. The recently launched
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201220/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/">UK
PubMed Central</ext-link> is doing a particularly nice job integrating
abstracts and fulltext articles.</p>
<p>The most interesting aspect of SciVerse is the possibility for 3rd
party developers to access the service via APIs and to develop both free
and commercial applications. We will see whether SciVerse develops into
an open platform that works with other publishers, funders and
institutions, or whether SciVerse will become a very large data silo.

that <italic><italic>Open data and open APIs offer huge opportunities
for research and innovation</italic></italic>, and earlier this week
Mendeley's Jason Hoyt
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201220/http://www.mendeley.com/blog/open-access/researcher-which-side-of-history/">wrote</ext-link>
something similar. Data is also at the heart of the business models of
many web-based companies â€“ let's hope that these two interests don't
collide.</p>
