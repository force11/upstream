<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://wikify.org/">Lambert
Heller</ext-link> and myself did a two-day workshop
<italic><italic>Reference Management in Times of Web
2.0</italic></italic> for a group of German librarians. We introduced
and tested the following five programs:</p>

<p>The goal of the workshop was to introduce the participants to the Web
2.0 aspects of these reference managers. We briefly talked about
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.mekentosj.com/papers">Papers</ext-link>
and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.citavi.com/">Citavi</ext-link>,
but neither of them offers any Web 2.0 functionality. The goal of the
workshop was <italic><italic>not</italic></italic> to pick the best
reference manager. With the exception of
<italic><italic>CiteULike</italic></italic> (which is more of a social
bookmarking service and can't be used to directly put references into
manuscripts), all of them are probably good choices for most users. For
some of the minor differences, please check my reference manager chart
that I have updated for the workshop (PDF

<p>We had used FriendFeed for the slides, links and comments in a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://friendfeed.com/bibman2">similar
workshop last July</ext-link>. This time we picked
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.sciencefeed.com/">ScienceFeed</ext-link>,
both because ScienceFeed can be used for reference management, and to
test the service that launched just three days earlier. The ScienceFeed
group can be found
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.sciencefeed.com/zblit2">here</ext-link>,
but is in German. FriendFeed and ScienceFeed are not only great for
conference microblogging, but are also excellent teaching tools,
especially in a workshop where every participant has an
internet-connected computer. We also had a few people listening in and
putting up comments.</p>
<p>The workshop did help me understand what could become one of the most
important features of reference managers. (I would exclude
<italic><italic>Endnote</italic></italic>, because it doesn't allow
public groups or sharing of fulltext files). Libraries used to be places
where you could find, store and read literature. A library would hold a
subset of all the available literature, but still far more texts than an
individual could keep at his home. A library serves as an intermediary
that helps the user get access to the literature he is interested
in.</p>
<p>A reference manager that stores all references and the associated
fulltext PDF files in an accessible (public or password-protected) place
can fullfill exactly the same role. It is not necessary that an
individual user stores every reference and fulltext paper on his own
computer. And he doesn't have to find all references for himself.
Librarians could help with this, e.g. by not only handling a users
search request, but also filing the associated PDF files in a group
folder. Other group folders would have the table of contents of your
favorite journals (e.g.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://www.citeulike.org/journals">CiteULike
Journals</ext-link>). We used to go to the library for exactly these
things. And now we do this all on our own, often not asking for help
from our local library.</p>

<p>In the last session I talked about non-traditional ways to find
scientific literature. Traditional would mean one of the following
search strategies, summarized by Duncan Hull et
al.<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033209/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/02/22/there_is_still_so_much_to_learn_in_reference_management/#fn1">1</ext-link></sup>:</p>
