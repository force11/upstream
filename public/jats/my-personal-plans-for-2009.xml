<p>The end of the year is always a time to think about the past and the
future. Even more so if you also have your birthday
(FemaleScienceProfessor calls it

Time Birthdays</ext-link>). Below are some of my plans for the next
year. The general theme: more overlap of science blogging with my
daytime job as physician treating cancer patients and doing cancer
research.</p>

  <title>Start a new job</title>
  <p>If everything works out as expected, I will start a new job next
  year. It will still be at my institution and will in fact be very
  similar, but will present new challenges and opportunities. One of
  these new opportunities is science communication, or how to
  communicate our efforts in cancer research and treating cancer
  patients both within our institution and to the public.</p>

  many different things to different people</ext-link>. Blogging about
  research (your own or that of other people) is one important part of
  it. In 2008 I have written only a few blog posts about research (e.g.

  <title>Start a new blog</title>
  <p>Related to the last two topics, I might start a new blog. This
  would be a German-language blog and would be an official blog of our
  institution. But first I have to convince a few people that such a
  blog is a good idea. I might ask

  Paper Journal Club</ext-link> is a Nature Network Forum to promote
  good scientific writing. It is a good idea and the forum has over 200
  members and some very interesting discussions, but it is very
  time-consuming to find good examples of well-written papers. The best
  approach would be regular contributions by a large number of people,
  but the incentives for doing so are probably not there. But it is
  possible to pick well-written papers from a journal I read anyway, so
  I will try to do that for <italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic> in
  regular intervals in 2009. And in January I will give my first seminar
  on science writing.</p>

  <title>Collaborate with fellow science bloggers</title>
  <p>We constantly have many interesting and (sometimes) important
  discussions. Why shouldn't more of these discussions turn into formal
  projects, e.g. a paper or a presentation at a science conference?
  Science bloggers are a very diverse mix of people, and this could lead
  to some very interesting approaches.</p>

  to do more cooking in 2009. Preparing good food is not only tasty and
  fun, but also a good distraction from the daytime work. And reading a
  good cookbook (for example
