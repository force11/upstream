is an international consortium for data citation. DataCite originally
started as a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://www.std-doi.de/front_content.php">project</ext-link>
at the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://www.tib-hannover.de/">German
National Library of Science and Technology (TIB)</ext-link>.</p>

<p>Since 2005 the TIB was providing digital object identifiers (DOIs) to
research datasets. In December 2009 research libraries and technical
information centres from 6 countries founded the DataCite initiative. In
December 2010 DataCite reach an important milestone by registering the
1,000,000th DOI name.</p>
<p>Many people are familiar with
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</ext-link>
which is providing DOIs for research papers. CrossRef is operated by
Publishers International Linking Association (PILA), a non-profit
organization formed by scholarly publishers in 2000. Think of DataCite
as the counterpart that is providing DOIs for research data. And as
research data are typically stored in data centers associated with
technical information centers  - e.g. the British Library or the  Canada
Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (CISTI) - and large
research libraries (e.g. California Digital Library), DataCite members
come from the academic community.</p>
<p>The TIB is located in Hannover, just a few miles away from Hannover
Medical School where I work. In December I sat down with Jan Brase from
the TIB, one of the driving forces behind DataCite and on its Board of
Directors. We talked not only about DataCite, but also how DataCite
could interoperate with
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</ext-link>,
the unique author identifier initiative (where I am a member of the
Board). One of the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://www.orcid.org/principles">aims</ext-link>
of ORCID is to create a <italic><italic>permanent, clear and unambiguous
record of scholarly communication,</italic></italic> and this of course
includes not only publications, but also the contribution of research
datasets. Gudmundur Thorisson gave a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/07/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy/">nice
presentation</ext-link> about the possible integration of DataCite and
ORCID in September.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Jan presented about DataCite at the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://www.ape2011.eu/">Academic
Publishing in Europe</ext-link> conference in Berlin. His slides are
available on SlideShare, the video of his talk (like all the other
presentations) will soon be available
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://river-valley.tv/">here</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Also this week Jan started the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://datacite.wordpress.com/">DataCite
blog</ext-link>. In his
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://datacite.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/some-more-details-on-2011/">first
post</ext-link> (after the obligatory welcome post) Jan talks about the
plans DataCite has for 2011. I am particularly excited about the central
metadata repository that should be up and running by June. DataCite has
allowed Thomson Reuters to crawl the repository so that the metadata
will also appear in the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611041541/http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/web_of_science/">Web
of Science</ext-link>. A lot of interesting stuff is going to happen in
2011 around unique identifiers for researchers and their scholarly
works.</p>
