<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</ext-link>
is a new service that I started last month with the simple idea to
automatically track all journal articles of a given author, and to
collect the article-level metrics (citations, bookmarks, etc.) for these
papers. ScienceCard requires unique identifiers for articles and authors
to work. Unique identifiers for authors is a difficult topic
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/orcid/">regularly
discussed</ext-link> in this blog. But I thought that using digital
object identifiers (DOI) for journal articles would be easy. The system
managed by CrossRef was started 10 years ago, and almost all journal
publishers now use DOIs – there were 49,350,542 registered CrossRef DOI
links as of today.</p>

<p>The first problem I encountered is that many bibliographic databases
don’t fully support DOIs. Most of them store DOIs, but not all of them
allow queries using DOIs, and very few services allow linking to them
using DOIs. In the end I had to store various other article identifiers
in ScienceCard (currently PubMed ID, PubMed Central ID, Microsoft
Academic Search ID, Mendeley UUID, Scopus ID). One side effect of this
proliferation of identifiers is that (in very rare cases) DOIs are not
unique in these bibliographic services. And it makes it more complicated
than necessary to build tools based on DOIs. The members of CrossRef are
publishers, the other service providers (whether public or private) seem
to be reluctant to fully support a service where they have no direct
influence.</p>
<p>The second problem with DOIs is that they are often not web-friendly.
DOIs are really permanent URLs, and CrossRef has recently changed the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://www.crossref.org/help/Content/02_Getting_started/Displaying_DOIs_in_print_and_online.htm">display
guidelines for DOIs</ext-link> to reflect this. Instead of
<bold><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010057">doi:
10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010057</ext-link></bold></bold> we are supposed to
show DOIs as
<bold><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010057">http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010057</ext-link></bold></bold>.
The problem is that DOIs can contain characters such as “+”, “(“, “.” or
“/” that need to be escaped when used as URLs. Some ScienceCard examples
include the following:</p>
<list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
    <p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0959-8049(05)80357-0">http://doi.org/10.1016/S0959-8049(05)80357-0</ext-link></p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/12.4.357">http://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/12.4.357</ext-link></p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi980175+">http://doi.org/10.1021/bi980175+</ext-link></p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119%5B0088:SSCPEO%5D2.0.CO;2">http://doi.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119[0088:SSCPEO]2.0.CO;2</ext-link></p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>These special characters can create problems when DOIs are used in
software programs. ScienceCard for example wants to create links to
articles in the format
<bold><bold>http://sciencecard.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119[0088:SSCPEO]2.0.CO;2.xml</bold></bold>,
but this function is currently broken.</p>
<p>One possible solution are
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://shortdoi.org/">shortDOIs</ext-link>.
Article (3) would for example become
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://doi.org/dcp">http://doi.org/dcp</ext-link>,
whereas article (4) is rejected as invalid DOI. I would love to use
shortDOIs in ScienceCard and other places (e.g. Twitter), but haven’t
found an API yet that automatically returns shortDOIs for DOIs.</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/03/26/direct-links-to-figures-and-tables-using-component-dois/">Component
DOIs</ext-link> directly link to a figure or table of a paper. This is
an underused, but very useful feature, and is for example provided by
the <italic><italic>PLoS</italic></italic> journals. Unfortunately
component DOIs can confuse bibliographic databases and make it more
difficult to track all the links to a given article. I had to write a
little routine to detect component DOIs imported into ScienceCard.</p>
<p>Articles are sometimes updated or corrected, and many publishers will
use a different DOI for the updated article. This is a problem when you
want to track all references to this particular article.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020121">http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020121</ext-link>
and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020181">http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020181</ext-link>
are for example DOIs for the same <italic><italic>PLoS Computational
Biology</italic></italic> article (the latter is the corrected version).
<italic><italic>Nature Precedings</italic></italic> uses a format that
is easier to understand for computers -
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/npre.2011.4479.3">http://doi.org/10.1038/npre.2011.4479.3</ext-link>
is for example a link to the third version of this particular
manuscript.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610120821/http://www.crossref.org/crossmark/index.html">CrossMark</ext-link>
is a new CrossRef service that will make it easier to track the
different versions of a manuscript, including retractions.</p>
<p>ScienceCard should of course not be limited to journal articles. I’m
also interested in other scholarly content, e.g. preprints from
<bold><bold>ArXiV</bold></bold> or research datasets from
<bold><bold>DataCite</bold></bold>. But I want to first solve the
problems with DOIs for journal articles, before I tackle the much bigger
problems with uniquely identifying and tracking other scholarly
contributions. Science blog posts are a good example. It would be
wonderful to track them in ScienceCard, but I don’t see how we can do
that before we have a system in place that assigns unique and persistent
identifiers to blog posts. For this and other reasons I really want
unique identifiers for science blog posts, and we should also think
about using DOIs for this purpose.</p>
