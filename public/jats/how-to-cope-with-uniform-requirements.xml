<p>You have finished all the experiments and are in the middle of
writing that wonderful manuscript that will change not only the field
you are working in but also your personal career. But then you encounter
all these complicated issues related to paper writing, including

<p>You understand that these are sensitive ethical issues and you want
to do the right thing. When is joint first authorship a problem, can I
publish a paper a second time if it is written in another language,
should my department head be a coauthor, etc. You will of course discuss
these questions with your coauthors, but where else can you look for
advice?</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p><italic><italic>Journal author guidelines.</italic></italic> The
    first and most useful place to look for advice, both for technical
    aspects, but also for ethical issues surrounding your manuscript.
    Author guidelines probably often are read too late (days before
    submission) and not carefully enough. The Editorial policies of
    <italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic> are found
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092424/http://www.nature.com/authors/editorial_policies/index.html">here</ext-link>.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><italic><italic>ICMJE (International Commitee of Medical Journal
    Editors)</italic></italic>. The
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092424/http://www.icmje.org/index.html">Uniform
    Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical
    Journals</ext-link> could be the next place for advice. The text
    contains a lot of useful information for both authors and editors,
    including special reporting guidelines such as
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092424/http://www.consort-statement.org/index.aspx?o=1011">CONSORT</ext-link>
    for randomized controlled trials.</p>

    <p><italic><italic>COPE (Committee on Publication
    Ethics)</italic></italic>
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092424/http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/">COPE</ext-link>
    is another useful resource that I recently discovered. I especially
    like the Case section, where real-life examples such as
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612092424/http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/cases/zeroseventwo">ghost

  </list-item>

<p>If there are still open questions after reading these guidelines,
join the regular discussion in the Nature Network blogs and forums on
these topics, most recently
