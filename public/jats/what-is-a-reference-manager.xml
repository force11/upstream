Stevens</ext-link> from the Open University. My own presentation has the
title <italic><italic>Trends in Reference Management</italic></italic>,
where I will try to focus on three emerging areas:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>Use of mobile devices for reference management (e.g.
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/02/08/nature-com-iphone-app-in-pictures">Nature.com

  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Social networks as discovery tools (using CiteULike, Twitter,
    FriendFeed, ResearchBlogging.org, etc. for finding relevant
    references instead of keyword searches in databases)</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Integration of unique author identifiers (specifically
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/01/03/orcid-or-how-to-build-a-unique-identifier-for-scientists-in-10-easy-steps">ORCID</ext-link>)
    into reference management tools. This will allow many interesting
    uses of reference lists (e.g. for automated researcher profiles or
    evaluation)</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>Reference management has obviously come a long way from the desktop
applications
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci00010a601">created
25 years ago</ext-link>. In 2010 it is difficult to give a good
description of the typical functions of reference managers. My 8 answers
are below.</p>
<fig>

<p>At their core all reference managers are databases that store
references. They should allow the user to create or import all required
reference types, find duplicate records, and connect references by the
same author or published in the same journal. I don't think any
reference manager completely supports even this small feature set (most
of them don't do author disambiguation). And we rarely use reference
managers in a much broader sense, e.g. for storing important blog posts
or references to research datasets (as

by Cameron Neylon</ext-link>).</p>
<fig>

</fig>
<p>Reference managers should put references into manuscripts, allowing a
variety of citation styles. Only a few reference managers allow the user
to edit citation styles, an important feature if an obscure style is
required. Surprisingly, the functionality for reference management is
usually not built into most word processors, but rather provided by the
reference management software.</p>

</fig>
<p>All reference managers can import references directly from
bibliographic databases, either by direct database connections, or via
bookmarklets.</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman4.jpg" xlink:title="" />
</fig>
<p>Some reference managers (most notably
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</ext-link>)
not only manage references, but also organize the full-text PDF files
associated with them. There are many good reasons to keep the assets
(such as scientific papers) and their metadata (the references)
connected, e.g. to allow full-text searches in your reference manager.
Scientific journals have started to embed reference metadata in
full-text PDF files
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2008/12/xmp_labelling_for_nature.html">XMP
Labelling for Nature</ext-link>), making it easier to connect reference
and PDF file.</p>

</fig>
<p>Many reference managers now offer a web-based version. This allows
using the same reference database with more than one computer and
sharing of references with others. Some reference managers (e.g.
CiteULike, RefWorks) only provide a web-based version.</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman6.jpg" xlink:title="" />
</fig>
<p>Many bibliographic databases (e.g. PubMed or Scopus) now allow user
accounts with storing of search strategies, interesting references, etc.
Does that make them reference managers?</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2010/11/refman7.jpg" xlink:title="" />
</fig>
<p>The flow of reference information has become much more complicated
than simply from online database to reference manager to manuscript.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/05/03/bibapp-mashups-for-universities">Institutional
bibliographies</ext-link> are a good example.</p>

</fig>
<p>More and more we find interesting references not via keyword searches
in databases, but rather through our social networks. This could be via
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032215/http://blog.citeulike.org/?p=136">CiteULike
recommendations</ext-link>, blog posts discussing a paper on
ResearchBlogging.org, or one of your contacts talking about an
interesting paper on Twitter, FriendFeed or Facebook. Current reference
managers don't provide good functionality to handle this user
behavior.</p>
