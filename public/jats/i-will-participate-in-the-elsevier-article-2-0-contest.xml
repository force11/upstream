<p>We have been talking a lot about Web 2.0 approaches for scientific
papers. Now Elsevier announced an
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092506/http://article20.elsevier.com/contest/home.htm">Article
2.0 Contest</ext-link>:</p>
<p><italic><italic>Demonstrate your best ideas for how scientific
research articles should be presented on the web and compete to win
great prizes!</italic></italic></p>
<p>The contest runs from September 1st until December 31st. Elsevier
will provide 7.500 full text articles in XML format (through a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092506/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</ext-link>
API). The contestants that creates the best article presentation
(creativity, value-add, ease of use and quality) will win prizes.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting contest, and I plan to participate. I do
know enough about programming web pages that I can create something
useful in four months. My development platform of choice is
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092506/http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby
on Rails</ext-link> and Rails has great REST support. I will use the
next two months before the contest starts to think about the features I
want to implement.</p>
<p>I'm sure that other people are also considering to participate in
this contest or would like to make suggestions for features. Please
contact me by commenting or via Email or
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092506/http://friendfeed.com/mfenner">FriendFeed</ext-link>.
A great opportunity to not only talk about Science 2.0, but actually do
something about it.</p>
