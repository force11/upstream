<p>David Crotty, the Executive Editor from CSH Protocols, last month
wrote a provocative blog post called
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090221/http://www.cshblogs.org/cshprotocols/2008/02/14/why-web-20-is-failing-in-biology/">Why
Web 2.0 is failing in Biology</ext-link>. He did an informal poll among
scientists and found that none of them read science blogs or use social
networking sites for scientists. His arguments why that is so?</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p><italic><italic>Time</italic></italic>. Scientists have little
    time, and rather spend this time in the laboratory or reading
    papers</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><italic><italic>Trust</italic></italic>. Web 2.0 sites for
    scientists haven't (yet) build a reputation. For important decisions
    (e.g. a critical protocol for an experiment), they rather ask a
    colleague they know.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><italic><italic>Inappropriate Tools</italic></italic>. The
    requirements for scientists are very different from the typical
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090221/http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</ext-link>
    or

    user.</p>

<p>I believe that David is right in his analysis that the big majority
of scientists (at least in the life sciences) don't read science blogs
or participate in social networking sites like <italic><italic>Nature
Network</italic></italic>. This could mean two things: a) Web 2.0 is not
working for biologists or b) we are just at the beginning and need to be
patient. As a science blogger I like to believe in b). Fortunately or
unfortunately, the success of any Web 2.0 project depends on a large
number of users.</p>
<p>As of 2008, I think that Science 2.0 (or whatever you want to call
it) has had a good start. But it is very important that we stay focused
on where we want to go and not get distracted by the possibilities that
the technology offers. One goal I've set for myself and have written
about in this blog: Web 2.0 should make the process of paper writing
much easier. This includes easy access to papers needed for your
manuscript (including open access), online writing tools such as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090221/http://www.buzzword.com/">Buzzword</ext-link>
or
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090221/http://docs.google.com/">Google
Docs</ext-link>, online tools for managing or sharing your references
(e.g.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090221/http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</ext-link>
or
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090221/http://www.refworks.com/">Refworks</ext-link>)
and tools for collaboration and coordination (e.g.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090221/http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</ext-link>).
Right now, the different pieces don't quite fit together, but the
potential is there for tremendous savings of time and money. And that is
attractive.</p>
