<p>Just four weeks ago I wrote a blog post titled
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2010/01/10/how-do-you-read-papers-2010-will-be-different">How
do you read papers? 2010 will be different</ext-link>. Not only have we
since seen the announcement of the Apple
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</ext-link>,
but last Monday the free Nature.com iPhone app was
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/iphone.html">launched</ext-link>.
The application gives access to the full text of all
<italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic> and <italic><italic>Nature
News</italic></italic> content (through until 30 April 2010, how access
is handled afterwards hasn't been announced yet). A version for the
<italic><italic>Android</italic></italic> platform was promised for
April, and the app will work with the just-announced
<italic><italic>iPad</italic></italic>. I included a few screenshots for
those without an iPhone or iPod Touch. A free Nature.com personal
account is needed to use the app.</p>

</fig>
<p>The iPhone app doesn't use HTML or PDF but rather
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2010/02/new_naturecom_iphone_app.html">the
ePub format</ext-link>. The Nature.com website will soon offer downloads
in ePub format (an example article is
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/article.epub">here</ext-link>).
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/">Adobe
Digital Editions</ext-link> and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.lexcycle.com/">Stanza</ext-link>
are examples of ePub readers. In contrast to PDF, ePub adapts to the
screen size and is therefore a much better format for the iPhone.</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102im_/http://gallery.me.com/mfenner/100079/IMG_0627/web.jpg" xlink:title="" />
</fig>
<p>References are links in the text, clicking on them opens a new
window.</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102im_/http://gallery.me.com/mfenner/100079/IMG_0628/web.jpg" xlink:title="" />
</fig>
<p>Figures are also links in the text that open in a new window. The
figures can be saved to the iPhone Photos application.</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102im_/http://gallery.me.com/mfenner/100079/IMG_0630/web.jpg" xlink:title="" />
</fig>
<p>The iPhone app also gives access to the full text of
<italic><italic>Nature News</italic></italic>. In contrast to
<italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic> papers, images are rendered
within the text.</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102im_/http://gallery.me.com/mfenner/100079/IMG_0640/web.jpg" xlink:title="" />
</fig>
<p><italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic> and <italic><italic>Nature
News</italic></italic> content, as well as PubMed search results can be
saved for later reading. This content (or rather the
<italic><italic>DOI</italic></italic>) is also available from the new
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.nature.com/mobileapps/web/bookmarks">Nature.com
mobile apps</ext-link> page. Because the <italic><italic>Nature.com
mobile apps</italic></italic> page stores only the
<italic><italic>DOI</italic></italic>, a
<italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic> subscription is required to
access the full-text article from there. From the
<italic><italic>Nature.com mobile apps</italic></italic> page you can
also export the citation in <italic><italic>RIS</italic></italic>
format.</p>
<p>The Nature.com iPhone app also searches both Nature.com and PubMed.
Regular searches can be saved.</p>

  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102im_/http://gallery.me.com/mfenner/100079/IMG_0633/web.jpg" xlink:title="" />
</fig>
<p>PubMed searches will retrieve abstracts, with a link to the full-text
article via the <italic><italic>DOI</italic></italic>.</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102im_/http://gallery.me.com/mfenner/100079/IMG_0635/web.jpg" xlink:title="" />

<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://mekentosj.com/papers/iphone/">Papers
for iPhone</ext-link> is another app that allows PubMed searches. You
can also search for the latest <italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic>
content, but the fulltext content is available only with a subscription
and only as HTML or PDF.</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102im_/http://gallery.me.com/mfenner/100079/IMG_0643/web.jpg" xlink:title="" />

<p>Support for
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.web-books.com/Publishing/epub.htm">ePub</ext-link>
is the most exiting feature for me, as it opens the door for many
interesting mobile applications. I hope that more scientific journals
will start to use the format (Hindawi was one of the first publishers
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/http://www.hindawi.com/epub.html">to
support ePub</ext-link>), and that we then start to see mobile apps for
more than a single journal.</p>
<p>Bug reports, suggestions and feature requests can be sent to
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611032102/mailto:mobile%40nature.com">mobile@nature.com</ext-link>.
