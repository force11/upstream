<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is currently recommending
public access of all papers from NIH-funded research.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080517063146/http://publicaccess.nih.gov/Final_Report_20060201.pdf"><bold>Fewer
than 5% of research papers</bold></ext-link> have gone this route since
the policy went into effect in 2005. On
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080517063146/http://www.scientificblogging.com/news/house_of_representatives_backs_faster_public_access_to_nih_studies"><bold>July
19, 2007</bold></ext-link> the House of Representatives passed the
FY2008 Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Bill that will make
public access within 12 months of publication a requirement for all
NIH-funded work. The bill still has to be approved by the Senate.</p>
<p>What is the policy of other granting agencies on open access
requirements for funded work?</p>
<p><bold>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</bold>
On June 26, 2007 the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080517063146/http://www.hhmi.org/news/20070626.html"><bold>HHMI</bold></ext-link>
announced that original research papers by HHMI scientists have to be
publicly available within 6 months of publication. The policy goes into
effect for all papers submitted on or after January 1, 2008 where a HHMI
scientist is first author, last author and/or corresponding author.</p>
<p><bold>Welcome Trust</bold>
All publications of research funded by the British
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100122231246/http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD002766.html"><bold>Welcome
Trust</bold></ext-link> have to be publicly available within 6 months of
publication since October 1, 2006.</p>
<p><bold>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</bold>
The German DFG has issued recommendations for open access in
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100122231246/http://www.dfg.de/aktuelles_presse/information_fuer_die_wissenschaft/andere_verfahren/info_wissenschaft_04_06.html"><bold>January
2006</bold></ext-link>. Although scientists receiving DFG grants are
encouraged to have their papers publicly available, there is no
requirement to do so.</p>
<p><bold>CNRS, INSERM, INRA and INRIA</bold>
The French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), the National
Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM), the National
Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) and the National Research
Institute for IT and Robotics (INRIA) have created
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100122231246/http://www2.cnrs.fr/en/332.htm"><bold>publicly
available institutional repositories</bold></ext-link> for their
researchers. Deposition of papers in these repositories is
voluntary.</p>
<p>In summary, there is a clear trend towards making open access a
requirement for funding. The taxpayer-funded research agencies – or
rather the legislators – have more problems with making this a
requirement than the private charities (Welcome Trust and HHMI).</p>
