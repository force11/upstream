<p>This year’s
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blogs.nature.com/ofschemesandmemes/2014/10/09/how-to-get-a-ticket-for-this-years-spoton-london">SpotOn
London conference</ext-link> takes place November 14-15 and the
registration has opened this Monday. I am helping organize this
conference since 2009, and I again look forward to the sessions, and -
more importantly - the discussions with people in and between sessions
this year.</p>
<p>The name (ScienceBlogging London, ScienceOnline London, SpotOn
London), the location (Royal Institution, British Library, Wellcome
Conference Center), the people organizing (too many to mention, but
Nature Publishing Group always at the core), and the fringe events (lots
of cool things from
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blog.mendeley.com/academic-life/science-blogging-2008-part-i/">science
tours</ext-link> to
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2012-fringe-event-the-story-collider-2/">Story
Collider</ext-link>) and the format have always changed slightly over
the years, and this year again is a bit different. The biggest change is
obviously that
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://twitter.com/louwoodley">Lou
Woodley</ext-link> is no longer an organizer (as she announced at last
year’s conference), but this is also the first SpotOn conference with a
theme:</p>
<p specific-use="wrapper">
  <disp-quote>
    <p>The challenges of balancing the public and the private in the
    digital age</p>
  </disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This is obviously a very broad topic, but nicely encompasses many
important issues that we are dealing with in scholarly communication
today. The draft program is posted
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blogs.nature.com/ofschemesandmemes/2014/10/13/spoton-london-2014-draft-programme">here</ext-link>,
and I’m helping organize the sessions on <bold><bold>sharing sensitive
data</bold></bold> and <bold><bold>open peer review</bold></bold>. More
details will follow for all these sessions.</p>
<p>The second day of the conference will be in unconference (or barcamp)
format and the program drafted by the delegates in the morning. This
format is popular in the science communications community (I first heard
about the project that became my current job at
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/i_was_at_scibarcamp_palo_alto/">SciBarCamp
in 2009</ext-link>), and SpotOn London has used this format in the first
conference in 2008 (and again in 2009):</p>

<p>For people not familiar with this format the idea of a conference
(day) without predetermined topics or speakers sounds scary. As it turns
out, the problem is usually not the lack of ideas or people wanting to
talk, but rather how to coordinate this in a way that everyone who wants
to get involved can do so, and it doesn’t become a discussion among
those with the loudest voices (and biggest egos). My experience with
SpotOn London and other conferences I enjoyed is that the best sessions
are usually those that allow for a good discussion, and not those with
the most polished PowerPoint slides. Some suggestions for when you
attend an unconference for the first time:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>go to sessions with topics you know little about, but want to
    learn more</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>when suggesting a session, do this together with others</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>suggest topics that are focussed and unusual, not the obvious
    ones we always talk about</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>don’t even think about doing a PowerPoint presentation</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>when moderating a session, be a good moderator, not a good
    speaker</p>
  </list-item>
