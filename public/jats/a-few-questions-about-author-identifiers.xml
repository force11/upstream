<p>The scientific articles we write are uniquely identified by
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151001190903/http://www.doi.org/">Digital
Object Identifiers</ext-link> (DOI). Many people believe that we also
need unique identifiers for the authors of those articles. Some of the
arguments why author identifiers could be very helpful are found in this

<p>Although most people agree that we need author identifiers for
scientists, many details of how this should be implemented are not
clear. I've listed some of the issues below. If possible, please take a
few minutes and answer the questions for yourself in

  <p>An author identifier should obviously uniquely identify an author.
  Some people like to add other functions, namely the ability to add a
  profile (e.g. a web page listing all papers of an author) and
  authentication. I think that the latter two functions can better be
  provided by a combination of unique identifier and some of today's
  tools (see also question #10).</p>

    <list-item>
      <p>No</p>

  <p>I think yes, and for the reasons that Geoffrey Bilder explained in

    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>The main reason that many people are reluctant to have author
  identifiers managed by a single institution is that they don't want a
  single publisher or other commercial entity to control this system.
  But both CrossRef and the National Library of Medicine have a good
  track record for implementing publishing standards. I would prefer
  Crossref, as the National Library of Medicine is only concerned with a
  subset of papers, i.e. the biomedical literature.</p>

      <p>Yes</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>No</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>I would say no. OpenID is a distributed system, which is not
  desirable as discussed in questions #5 and #10. And OpenID also
  handles authentication, something which isn't necessarily required (as
  discussed in question #1).</p>

    <list-item>
      <p>Several with one top system</p>
    </list-item>

  <p>Similar to the DOI, I want only one unique author identifier. But
  this one unique identifier can then be linked to several other
  systems, e.g. an OpenID for authentication or a Nature Network,
  LinkedIn or Mendeley profile to list all your papers and other
  contributions.</p>
  <p>I hope that enough people also answer these questions in the
