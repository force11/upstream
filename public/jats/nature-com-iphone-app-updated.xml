about</ext-link> the Nature.com iPhone application that was released in
February. Two weeks ago the app was updated with the following
changes:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>Access to abstracts from additional journals:
    <italic><italic>Nature Genetics</italic></italic>,
    <italic><italic>Nature Medicine</italic></italic>,
    <italic><italic>Nature Biotechnology</italic></italic>,
    <italic><italic>Nature Reviews Microbiology</italic></italic>,
    <italic><italic>Nature Reviews Genetics, Nature
    Physics</italic></italic> and <italic><italic>Nature
    Communications.</italic></italic></p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><italic><italic>Access to fulltext articles for a monthly
    subscription fee ($9.99 for Nature, $8.99 for the other journals).
    Access to Nature News and Nature Communications is
    free.</italic></italic></p>

additional journals, but can still read full-text articles from
Nature.</p>
<p>Reading papers on the iPad for me is a lot of fun. The reading
experience on the iPhone/iPod touch is very different, and not something
I would spend $9.99 a month for. But it is obvious where this is
heading: many users (including myself) would probably spend $9.99/month
for a nicely done iPad version of Nature. Especially if content is
free/cheaper with an institutional subscription. And we can already read
PLoS content for free with the
