a first beta version of their fonts. STIX stands for Scientific and
Technical Information Exchange and the fonts were designed specifically
for publishing scientific or mathematical texts. The
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611104808/http://www.stixfonts.org/">STIX
Project</ext-link> was started more than 10 years ago and is a
collaboration of the American Chemical Society (ACS), the American
Institute of Physics (AIP), the American Mathematical Society (AMS), the
American Physical Society (APS), Elsevier, and the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). A typical scientific text

The STIX fonts should be a tremendous help for them.</p>
