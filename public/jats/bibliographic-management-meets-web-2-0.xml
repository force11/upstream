<p>Regular readers of this blog know that I often talk about
bibliographic management tools (most recently
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/what-is-the-right-reference-manager-for-you">here</ext-link>
and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/reference-manager-overview">here</ext-link>),
and it was probably for this reason that I was invited to an interesting
full-day workshop last week at the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://www.royalfree.nhs.uk/">Royal
Free Hospital Medical Library</ext-link> in London:
<italic><italic>Bibliographic Management meets Web
2.0</italic></italic>. The event was organized by science librarians

librarians. We had demos of the following software:</p>

<p>This is a fairly complete list of bibliographic software with Web 2.0
features. Missing are some tools with similar features, as there simply
wasn't enough time and money to invite them all (e.g.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://www.2collab.com/">2collab</ext-link>
and

several popular programs without these features

files used by LaTeX.</p>

<p>I gave a brief introduction of what features I would look for in a
reference manager today (available on
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://www.slideshare.net/mfenner/which-reference-manager">slideshare</ext-link>).
The six presenters then took up a challenge (Word file
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://friendfeed-media.com/f9221d4c733652d64845e3dc6e0c17eaea9a05a2">here</ext-link>)
that was given to them the week before. We used a simplified version of
a set of tasks (find reference, put citation into Word document, etc.)
originally developed for
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://citefest.pbworks.com/">CiteFest</ext-link>
at Northwestern University. Every participant was sitting in front of a
computer and follow along with the tasks (the technical staff at the
Royal Free did a marvelous job installing the software and bookmarklets
on all computers before the workshop). The demos were nicely captured in
the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://friendfeed.com/bibman2">FriendFeed
room</ext-link> we have set up for the workshop, so you can follow the
details of the sessions there (the room also has some excellent links to
other resources).</p>
<p>In the discussion at the end we all felt that all reference managers
used that day were up to the challenge
(<italic><italic>Connotea</italic></italic> and
<italic><italic>CiteULike</italic></italic> couldn't put references into
a Word document, but managed the rest of the tasks perfectly), and we
decided not to declare a winner. We also felt that the market is
developing so fast, that a feature comparison looked very different 12
months ago (e.g. <italic><italic>Mendeley</italic></italic> just
launched, no Web version of <italic><italic>Zotero</italic></italic>),
and will again look very different 12 months from today. Most librarians
in the room therefore felt that they probably have to support most of
these tools at their institutions. We briefly talked about the cost of
these tools (of the tools that were demoed, only
<italic><italic>Endnoteweb</italic></italic> and
<italic><italic>Refworks</italic></italic> are commercial). This might
be an issue when licenses have to be renewed. I've set up a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/03/15/reference-manager-overview">reference
manager feature comparison chart</ext-link> a few months ago, and have
updated this chart after the workshop.</p>
<p>One feature I really like in <italic><italic>Papers</italic></italic>
is full-text search of the PDF files in your library, which I think is a
much easier way to find information than tagging (and David Crotty
agrees with me:
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://www.cshblogs.org/cshprotocols/2009/02/23/why-article-tagging-doesnt-work/">Why
article tagging doesn't work</ext-link>). I was therefore happy to see
that <italic><italic>Zotero</italic></italic>,
<italic><italic>Mendeley</italic></italic>,
<italic><italic>CiteULike</italic></italic> and
<italic><italic>Refworks</italic></italic> all support this feature,
something I have overlooked before. Full-text search is one more reason
that online reference managers should be able to store PDF files.
Another reason is that several people working on the same research
project shouldn't all have to go out and download the full-text files
themselves â€“ or even worse, email them to each other. This sharing is
not only an important features of Web 2.0 bibliographic tools, but is
obviously also an area of potential problems with copyright (for papers
that are not Open Access). <italic><italic>CiteULike</italic></italic>,
<italic><italic>Mendeley</italic></italic> and
<italic><italic>Refworks</italic></italic> all try to avoid these kinds
of issues by allowing sharing of references and PDF files in private
groups with a limited number of users.</p>
<p>It was interesting to see that the tools use very different
approaches to integrate with the Web.
<italic><italic>Connotea</italic></italic>,
<italic><italic>CiteUlike</italic></italic> and
<italic><italic>Refworks</italic></italic> are Web-based tools (the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064949/http://www.refworks.com/refworks/WNCDownload.asp">Refworks
Write-N-Cite Windows module</ext-link> can download the reference
database for read-only offline use), whereas
<italic><italic>Zotero</italic></italic>,
<italic><italic>Mendeley</italic></italic> and
<italic><italic>Endnote</italic></italic> synchronize between a desktop
version and web version. I'm really torn between these two approaches.
Web-only reduces the cost of development and maintenance (no need to
develop separate versions for Web/Windows/Mac/Linux, users don't have to
install new versions). Desktop/Web allows offline use users always have
a copy of their data on their computer. There is probably no right
answer to this, email is another example where both approaches are very
successful.</p>
<p>Only after the meeting did I realize another interesting difference
between the various tools. They all have different business models
behind them: <italic><italic>Endnoteweb</italic></italic>: (mostly)
single-user licenses, <italic><italic>Refworks</italic></italic>: site
licenses, <italic><italic>Connotea</italic></italic>: owned by a
publisher, <italic><italic>CiteUlike</italic></italic>: independent with
support from a publisher, <italic><italic>Zotero</italic></italic>: Open
Source and <italic><italic>Mendeley</italic></italic>: Web 2.0 company
that plans free and paid services. This might actually be a deciding
factor in determining which of these tools will be the most successful
in the long-term future.</p>
<p>But in the end, the similarities far outweigh the differences between
these tools. We didn't have time left to talk more about this, but for
Bibliographic Management to move to Web 2.0, it's not really just about
technology, but rather mostly about the users. We had an interesting
discussion about that topic a few weeks ago
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/how-to-close-the-digital-divide-among-scientists">How
to close the digital divide among scientists</ext-link>). I believe that
ultimately your collection of references should sit in a database that
is accessible from the web. Some references you want to share with
everybody (e.g. via tools like FriendFeed), and that includes your own
publications. And some references you want to share with private groups
of people, e.g. people in your lab or when coauthoring a paper. All the
tools presented in the workshop allow you to do that.</p>
