<p>Earlier this month, Apple announced the productivity suite
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122831/http://www.apple.com/iwork/">iWork
08</ext-link> for Macintosh users. iWork 08 includes
<italic><italic>Numbers</italic></italic>, a new spreadsheet application
and updated versions of the presentation and word processing
applications <italic><italic>Keynote</italic></italic> and
<italic><italic>Pages</italic></italic>. iWork runs natively (i.e.
faster) on Intel Macs and can export to the Microsoft Office 2007 format

blog post</ext-link> about problems with this format for scientific
publishing).</p>
<sec id="numbers">
  <title>Numbers</title>
  <p>The new spreadsheet application in iWork 08. The good mix of
  graphics, calculating and charting could make this a good tool to
  create scientific posters. I'm a longtime Freehand user for this
  purpose, but since further development
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122831/http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2007/05/freehand_no_lon.html">has
  been stopped in favor of Adobe Illustrator</ext-link>, I'm looking for
  alternatives. Just as in Keynote and Pages, more sophisticated
  charting options (e.g. displaying standard deviations) are not
  supported. In contrast to Keynote and Pages, Numbers has no
  Applescript support.</p>

<sec id="keynote">
  <title>Keynote</title>
  <p>Keynote is a wonderful application for presentations and I have
  been using it for many years. Key new features in Keynote 08 are
  animations and instant alpha, an image editing tool to remove
  backgrounds. Highly recommended.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="pages">
  <title>Pages</title>
  <p>Pages is a good word processing application that is especially
  suited for graphics-rich documents. Pages 08 can track changes made in
  a document, and this feature is preserved when exporting to Microsoft
  Word format. Pages doesn't offer integration with Bibliography tools
  such as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122831/http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</ext-link>
  or
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122831/http://www.thirdstreetsoftware.com/index.cgi?page=sente">Sente</ext-link>,
  and at least part of the reason is the missing programming interface
  that would allow third-party applications to integrate with Pages.
  Without bibliographic tools, Pages can't be recommended for any larger
  scientific text.</p>
  <p>In summary, with the exception of Keynote, iWork is not quite ready
  for scientists. Adding solid bibliographic features in Pages could
  change all that. A 469 MB 30-day trial version version can be
  downloaded
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122831/http://www.apple.com/iwork/trial/">here</ext-link>.
  iWork costs $79 (US), €79 (EU) or £55 (UK).</p>
