just finished a few hours ago, and from what everyone was saying it was
yet another wonderful meeting. I attended last year and moderated a
session called

best to follow the meeting via

and of course
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/BlogMedia_Coverage/">blogs
and media</ext-link>. There was even a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://scienceblogs.com/scienceonline/2010/01/scienceonline2010_iphone_app.php">ScienceOnline2010
iPhone app</ext-link>. Another ScienceOnline2010 trend was the
widespread use of
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.theflip.com/">Flip</ext-link>
for short videos such as this one:</p>
<p>The overall online coverage far exceeds what I see at my usual
science meetings, but following the sessions live (including the ability
to ask questions) is far more difficult. For that you need video and
microblogging (or the two combined in <italic><italic>Second
Life</italic></italic>). Video of sessions from two rooms was streamed
live at
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.ustream.tv/channel/scienceonline2010">Ustream</ext-link>
and <italic><italic>Second Life</italic></italic>, but Ustream didn't
always work for me (didn't try Second Life, all sessions were recorded
and will appear on <italic><italic>YouTube</italic></italic> next
week).</p>
<p>For me and many others <italic><italic>FriendFeed</italic></italic>
is the perfect microblogging tool for conferences
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263">Microblogging
the ISMB: A New Approach to Conference Reporting</ext-link>). But the
use of <italic><italic>FriendFeed</italic></italic> in Science 2.0
conferences seems on the decline during the last 12 months because of
<italic><italic>Twitter</italic></italic>, and at
<italic><italic>ScienceOnline2010</italic></italic> it was no longer
possible to follow sessions using
<italic><italic>FriendFeed</italic></italic>.
<italic><italic>Twitter</italic></italic> is wonderful for many things,
but makes it very difficult to create a connected discussion around a
particular topic such as a conference session. But the
<italic><italic>Twitter</italic></italic> board was cool:</p>

<p>After <italic><italic>ScienceOnline2010</italic></italic> is before

<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://blog.f1000.com/2010/01/15/on-the-run&amp;acirc;&amp;#128;&amp;#148;15jan10/">first
planning meeting</ext-link> took place last Friday. We hope to announce
the location and date in the coming weeks, but we are aiming for a
bigger (with enough room for at least 250 people) and longer (two days)
meeting with enough parallel sessions to cover all the topics that we
care about.</p>
<p>One personal goal I have for <italic><italic>Science Online London
2010</italic></italic> is to provide an even better experience for those
unable to attend in person. <italic><italic>Second
Life</italic></italic> worked
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://network.nature.com/people/joannascott/blog/2009/09/07/science-online-london-links">pretty
well</ext-link> for us last year, and we even had one speaker
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/telepresent_at_the_future/">giving
his presentation</ext-link> this way. But maybe we can do better.
Livestreaming of good quality audio is probably the most important
thing, the video quality seems less critical. Alternatively, we can
synchronize the audio with the slides from the presentation, something
<italic><italic>SlideShare</italic></italic> calls
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111833/http://www.slideshare.net/faqs/slidecast">SlideCast</ext-link>.
We might also find better ways to use
<italic><italic>Twitter</italic></italic> for microblogging, e.g. by
using separate hashtags for every session and a
<italic><italic>Twitter</italic></italic> board in the sessions.</p>
