<p><italic>Article-level metrics (ALMs) provide a wide range of metrics
about the uptake of an individual journal article by the scientific
community after publication. They include citations, usage statistics,
discussions in online comments and social media, social bookmarking, and
recommendations. In this essay, we describe why article-level metrics
are an important extension of traditional citation-based journal metrics
and provide a number of example from ALM data collected for PLOS
Biology.</italic></p>

<p>The scientific impact of a particular piece of research is reflected
in how this work is taken up by the scientific community. The first
systematic approach that was used to assess impact, based on the
technology available at the time, was to track citations and aggregate
them by journal. This strategy is not only no longer necessary â€” since
now we can easily track citations for individual articles â€” but also,
and more importantly, journal-based metrics are now considered a poor
performance measure for individual articles (Campbell, 2008; Glänzel
&amp; Wouters, 2013). One major problem with journal-based metrics is
the variation in citations per article, which means that a small
percentage of articles can skew, and are responsible for, the majority
of the journal-based citation impact factor, as shown by Campbell (2008)
for the 2004 <italic>Nature</italic> Journal Impact Factor.
<bold><bold>Figure 1</bold></bold> further illustrates this point,
showing the wide distribution of citation counts between <italic>PLOS
Biology</italic> research articles published in 2010. <italic>PLOS
Biology</italic> research articles published in 2010 have been cited a
median 19 times to date in Scopus, but 10% of them have been cited 50 or
more times, and two articles (Dickson, Wang, Krantz, Hakonarson, &amp;
Goldstein, 2010; Narendra et al., 2010) more than 300 times.
<italic>PLOS Biology</italic> metrics are used as examples throughout
this essay, and the dataset is available in the supporting information
(<bold><bold>Data S1</bold></bold>). Similar data are available for an
increasing number of other publications and organizations.</p>

<p>Scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be
adequately measured by any single indicator (Bollen, Sompel, Hagberg,
&amp; Chute, 2009; Glänzel &amp; Wouters, 2013; Schekman &amp;
Patterson, 2013). To this end, PLOS has collected and displayed a
variety of metrics for all its articles since 2009. The array of
different categorised article-level metrics (ALMs) used and provided by
PLOS as of August 2013 are shown in <bold><bold>Figure 2</bold></bold>.
In addition to citations and usage statistics, i.e., how often an
article has been viewed and downloaded, PLOS also collects metrics
about: how often an article has been saved in online reference managers,
such as Mendeley; how often an article has been discussed in its
comments section online, and also in science blogs or in social media;
and how often an article has been recommended by other scientists. These
additional metrics provide valuable information that we would miss if we
only consider citations. Two important shortcomings of citation-based
metrics are that (1) they take years to accumulate and (2) citation
analysis is not always the best indicator of impact in more practical
fields, such as clinical medicine (Eck, Waltman, Raan, Klautz, &amp;
Peul, 2013). Usage statistics often better reflect the impact of work in
more practical fields, and they also sometimes better highlight articles
of general interest (for example, the 2006 <italic>PLOS Biology</italic>
article on the citation advantage of Open Access articles (Eysenbach,
2006), one of the 10 most-viewed articles published in <italic>PLOS
Biology</italic>).</p>

<p>A bubble chart showing all 2010 <italic>PLOS Biology</italic>
articles (<bold><bold>Figure 3</bold></bold>) gives a good overview of
the year’s views and citations, plus it shows the influence that the
article type (as indicated by dot color) has on an article’s performance
as measured by these metrics. The weekly <italic>PLOS Biology</italic>
publication schedule is reflected in this figure, with articles
published on the same day present in a vertical line. <bold><bold>Figure
3</bold></bold> also shows that the two most highly cited 2010
<italic>PLOS Biology</italic> research articles are also among the most
viewed (indicated by the red arrows), but overall there isn’t a strong
correlation between citations and views. The most-viewed article
published in 2010 in <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> is an essay on
Darwinian selection in robots (Floreano &amp; Keller, 2010). Detailed
usage statistics also allow speculatulation about the different ways
that readers access and make use of published literature; some articles
are browsed or read online due to general interest while others that are
downloaded (and perhaps also printed) may reflect the reader’s intention
to look at the data and results in detail and to return to the article
more than once.</p>

<p>When readers first see an interesting article, their response is
often to view or download it. By contrast, a citation may be one of the
last outcomes of their interest, occuring only about 1 in 300 times a
PLOS paper is viewed online. A lot of things happen in between these
potential responses, ranging from discussions in comments, social media,
and blogs, to bookmarking, to linking from websites. These activities
are usually subsumed under the term â€œaltmetrics,â€? and their variety
can be overwhelming. Therefore, it helps to group them together into
categories, and several organizations, including PLOS, are using the
category labels of Viewed, Cited, Saved, Discussed, and Recommended
(<bold><bold>Figures 2 and 4</bold></bold>, see also (Lin &amp; Fenner,
2013)).</p>

<p>All <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> articles are viewed and downloaded,
and almost all of them (all research articles and nearly all front
matter) will be cited sooner or later. Almost all of them will also be
bookmarked in online reference managers, such as Mendeley, but the
percentage of articles that are discussed online is much smaller. Some
of these percentages are time dependent; the use of social media
discussion platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook for example, has
increased in recent years (93% of <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> research
articles published since June 2012 have been discussed on Twitter, and
63% mentioned on Facebook). These are the locations where most of the
online discussion around published articles currently seems to take
place; the percentage of papers with comments on the PLOS website or
that have science blog posts written about them is much smaller. Not all
of this online discussion is about research articles, and perhaps, not
surprisingly, the most-tweeted PLOS article overall (with more than
1,100 tweets) is a <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> perspective on the use
of social media for scientists (Bik &amp; Goldstein, 2013).</p>
<p>Some metrics are not so much indicators of a broad online discussion,
but rather focus on highlighting articles of particular interest. For
example, science blogs allow a more detailed discussion of an article as
compared to comments or tweets, and journals themselves sometimes choose
to highlight a paper on their own blogs, allowing for a more digestible
explanation of the science for the non-expert reader (Fausto et al.,
2012). Coverage by other bloggers also serves the same purpose; a good
example of this is one recent post on the OpenHelix Blog (“Video Tip of
the Week: Turkeys and their genomes,” 2012) that contains video footage
of the second author of a 2010 <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> article
(Dalloul et al., 2010) discussing the turkey genome.</p>
<p>F1000Prime, a commercial service of recommendations by expert
scientists, was added to the PLOS Article-Level Metrics in August 2013.
We now highlight on the PLOS website when any articles have received at
least one recommendation within F1000Prime. We also monitor when an
article has been cited within the widely used modern-day online
encyclopedia, Wikipedia. A good example of the latter is the Tasmanian
devil Wikipedia page (“Tasmanian devil,” 2013) that links to a
<italic>PLOS Biology</italic> research article published in 2010
(Nilsson et al., 2010). While a F1000Prime recommendation is a strong
endorsement from peer(s) in the scientific community, being included in
a Wikipedia page is akin to making it into a textbook about the subject
area and being read by a much wider audience that goes beyond the
scientific community.</p>
<p><italic>PLOS Biology</italic> is the PLOS journal with the highest
percentage of articles recommended in F1000Prime and mentioned in
Wikipedia, but there is only partial overlap between the two groups of
articles because they focus on different audiences (<bold><bold>Figure
5</bold></bold>). These recommendations and mentions in turn show
correlations with other metrics, but not simple ones; you can’t assume,
for example, that highly cited articles are more likely to be
recommended by F1000Prime, so it will be interesting to monitor these
trends now that we include this information.</p>

<p>With the increasing availability of ALM data, there comes a growing
need to provide tools that will allow the community to interrogate them.
A good first step for researchers, research administrators, and others
interested in looking at the metrics of a larger set of PLOS articles is
the recently launched ALM Reports tool (“ALM Reports,” 2013). There are
also a growing number of service providers, including
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://altmetric.com/">Altmetric.com</ext-link>
(“<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://altmetric.com/">Altmetric.com</ext-link>,”
2013), ImpactStory (“ImpactStory,” 2013), and Plum Analytics (“Plum
Analytics,” 2013) that provide similar services for articles from other
publishers.</p>
<p>As article-level metrics become increasingly used by publishers,
funders, universities, and researchers, one of the major challenges to
overcome is ensuring that standards and best practices are widely
adopted and understood. The National Information Standards Organization
(NISO) was recently awarded a grant by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to
work on this (“NISO Alternative Assessment Metrics (Altmetrics)
Project,” 2013), and PLOS is actively involved in this project. We look
forward to further developing our article-level metrics and to having
them adopted by other publishers, which hopefully will pave the way to
their wide incorporation into research and researcher assessments.</p>
