<p>Iâ€™ve written a similar post
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/03/31/pubmed-and-other-annoyances-in-the-paper-writing-process"><bold>before</bold></ext-link>,
put I would like to talk about some of the features that I would like to
see in an ideal paper writing application.</p>
<p><bold>Intelligent Formatting</bold>
Content and formatting should be separated from each other. A manuscript
should require as little formatting as possible, and that formatting
(including the format of references) should be defined in a Journal
style that is automatically applied to the manuscript.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.wolfram.com/products/publicon/index.html"><bold>Publicon</bold></ext-link>
by Wolfram Research tried to achieve this, but unfortunately appears to
be a dead product.</p>
<p><bold>References</bold>
A reference database should be integrated into the paper writing
application. Ideally this would be a web-based database such as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.connotea.org/"><bold>Connotea</bold></ext-link>,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.citeulike.org/"><bold>CiteULike</bold></ext-link>.
Both

and

Web</bold></ext-link> already offer some level of integration.</p>
<p><bold>Versioning</bold>
Storing all versions of a manuscript is very important for obvious
reasons: backup, keeping track of revisions and coordinating the input
from more than one author. Version control is standard practice in
software development, using tools like
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://subversion.tigris.org/"><bold>Subversion</bold></ext-link>
or the newer
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://git.or.cz/index.html"><bold>Git</bold></ext-link>.</p>
<p><bold>Integration with Online Submission Systems</bold>
Submitting a manuscript to an online manuscript submission system such
as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.editorialmanager.com/homepage/home.htm"><bold>EditorialManager</bold></ext-link>
or
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.topazproject.org/trac/"><bold>Topaz</bold></ext-link>
is too complicated. This process could and should be automated.</p>
<p><bold>Summary</bold>
My Paper Writing Dream Machine will in all likelihood turn out to be a
web-based application, using on one of the more advanced platforms
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://gears.google.com/"><bold>Google
Gears</bold></ext-link>,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://silverlight.net/"><bold>Microsoft
Silverlight</bold></ext-link> or
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://www.adobe.com/de/products/flex/"><bold>Adobe
Flex</bold></ext-link>. And the data will be in XML using a standard
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105337/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Definition"><bold>DTD</bold></ext-link>.
Some of the pieces of the puzzle already exist, but nobody has yet put
them together in a way that it creates a compelling alternative to the
currently used systems.</p>
