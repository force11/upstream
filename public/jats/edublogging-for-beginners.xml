<p>This blog entry is primarily intended for science educators that are
interested in starting a blog for their teaching activities. Some of
them will not be familiar with blogging and other web 2.0 tools. Not the
typical audience of this blog, but I would greatly appreciate feedback,
as I'm in the process of writing an article about this topic (in
German).</p>

  <title>What is blogging and all this web 2.0 stuff?</title>
  <p>A good starting point is

<sec id="why-should-i-start-a-blog">
  <title>Why should I start a blog?</title>
  <p>Because a blog could help with teaching students. A blog can serve
  as a simple noticeboard for lecture topics, homework assignments, etc.
  It is also a great place to post additional material. But more
  importantly, students can comment, ask questions or make suggestions.

  out</ext-link> that blogs (and other online tools) can save time (and
  money) compared to one-by-one interactions in person or via email. The
  motivation for students is nicely explained in

  blog post</ext-link> by Meredith Farkas: blogging or posting comments
  on blogs is a great way for students to reflect what they have learned
  and to discuss it with fellow students. Tony Griffith recently talked
  about

  do students find genetics so difficult to learn?</ext-link>. He
  emphasized that students typically are not taught the

  problem-solving are more important than learning facts.</p>

<sec id="where-do-i-host-the-blog">
  <title>Where do I host the blog?</title>
  <p>Most teaching blogs will be hosted at a university server. The
  university IT department will probably offer a blogging platform such
  as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://movabletype.org/">MovableType</ext-link>
  or
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</ext-link>.
  If the university IT department doesn't offer such a service, blogs
  can also be hosted somewhere else.

  additional features such as a central portal for all blogs, class
  blogs, access restricted to students, control of student entries.</p>

  <title>Where can I find other people interested in
  edublogging?</title>
  <p>Many science bloggers are also involved in edublogging, and you
  find interesting discussions about edublogging both here in Nature
  Network or in many other science blogs (e.g.
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://search.technorati.com/edublog">here</ext-link>).
  The Edublogs magazine (e.g.
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928190257/http://magazine.edublogs.org/2008/01/28/who-are-the-top-edubloggers/">this
  post</ext-link> on popular edubloggers) is another good starting
  point.</p>
