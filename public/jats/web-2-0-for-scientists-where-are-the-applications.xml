or failure</ext-link> of Web 2.0 efforts for scientists depends to a
large extend on the availability of cool applications that make the
everyday life of a scientist easier. Many of these applications of
course already exist, but I would argue that there is a lot of room for
improvement. And I would also argue that in a lot of cases we just have
to take the example of the Web 2.0 world and adapt it to the needs of
scientists â€“ Nature Network itself would be an example of this
approach.</p>
<sec id="meetings-and-seminars">
  <title>Meetings and Seminars</title>
  <p>Scientific meetings and seminars are one example were we can do
  better. Web 2.0 is an ideal approach for this, and
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://upcoming.yahoo.com/">Upcoming</ext-link>
  is the classic application. There are of course a number of websites
  that list meetings and seminars for scientists, but they either focus
  on the big meetings or list just the seminars of a particular
  institution. Look at the discussion

  Berlin Forum to see what I mean.</p>

  <title>What can we do to improve the situation?</title>
  <p>We can wait that either one of the big players or a clever startup
  has a great idea. But one of the attractive features of Web 2.0 is
  user participation. We need more discussions between scientists and
  software developers on what is needed and what can be done. These
  discussions are of course already taking place, but science bloggers
  can do more to collect interesting ideas and articulate them. We want
  the integration of reference managers in online writing tools such as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://docs.google.com/">Google
  Docs</ext-link> or
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103012/http://www.buzzword.com/">Buzzword</ext-link>,
  but how do we make our voice heard?</p>
  <p>Secondly, we can write applications ourselves. The barriers of
  entry have become really low, and one reason are the APIs (application
  programming interfaces) of both science applications or conventional
  Web 2.0 apps:</p>

  of a Nature Network API. With some skills in PHP, Python, Java or
  Ruby, anybody could create an interesting mashup with these APIs over
  a weekend. Maybe linking Connotea tags to YouTube videos and Flickr
  pictures?</p>
