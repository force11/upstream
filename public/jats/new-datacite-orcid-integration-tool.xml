<p>A
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://datacite.labs.orcid-eu.org/">new
service</ext-link> allows researchers to add research datasets – and
other content with DataCite DOIs, including all
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://figshare.com/">figshare</ext-link>
content – to their
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://about.orcid.org/">ORCID</ext-link>
profile by integrating with the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://search.datacite.org/ui">DataCite
Metadata Store</ext-link>. The tool is an adaption (or fork) of the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://search.crossref.org/">CrossRef

<p>There are many things I like about this new DataCite/ORCID
integration tool:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>it makes it easier for researchers to get credit for their
    research outputs.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>it shows the value of persistent identifiers for data,
    publications and people, and linking them together</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>it shows the Creative Commons licenses for DataCite content where
    this info is available, facilitating reuse of content</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>it demonstrates the power of open source (thanks CrossRef!), open
    collaboration, standard REST APIs, and lightweight programming
    (Sinatra/Ruby) and deployment (Vagrant, Amazon EC2, Rackspace)
    tools</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>it shows that we don’t need a single – often closed – system, but
    open services that build on top of each other using accepted
    community standards. Tools using the ORCID API can immediately reuse
    the new DataCite content, altmetrics provided by
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://impactstory.org/">ImpactStory</ext-link>
    are a good example</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>I want to explore some of these ideas in the panel <bold>Attribution:
Managing Provenance, Ethics, and Metrics</bold> at the combined
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://orcid.org/orcid-outreach-meeting-symposium-and-codefest-may-2013">ORCID/Dryad
