<p>Donald Kennedy, the edior-in-chief of Science, yesterday wrote an

about a legal dispute between the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110359/http://www.nejm.org/">New
England Journal of Medicine</ext-link> and the drug company
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110359/http://www.pfizer.com/">Pfizer</ext-link>.
Pfizer wants the NEJM to provide the reviewer comments on submitted
papers about the two Pfizer products celecoxib (Celebrex) and valdecoxib
(Bextra). Both drugs are used to treat pain and belong to the COX-2
inhibitor class of drugs. Rofecoxib (Vioxx) is another COX-2 inhibitor
produced by Merck. Rofecoxib and valdecoxib, but not celecoxib were
withdrawn from the market about three years ago because of an increased
risk of cardiovascular side effects, including heart attacks.</p>
<p>Research findings about cardiovascular side effects of COX-2
inhibitors are at the center of the dispute and Pfizer is now seeking
arguments for their case not just from published papers but also in
confidential peer reviews and manuscripts that were rejected. This legal
dispute is important because it touches central aspects of the peer
review process.</p>
<p>The findings of scientific papers can have consequences not only to
the scientific community involved, but also for the personal fortunes of
their authors (e.g. new jobs or grants), the treatment of patients, our
policies towards climate change â€“ or the profit of a drug company. With
that much at stake, the temptation to move the scientific argument from
the editorial office to the courtroom is there. We should resist this
temptation, or the peer review process and the way we communicate
science will never be the same again.</p>
