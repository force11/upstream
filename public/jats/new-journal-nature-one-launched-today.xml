<p>It’s very unusual for me to post two blog posts in a single day, and
even more so when both posts are based on press releases by the same
organization. But this is important news for everybody interested in
scholarly publishing.</p>
<p>In a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/scientificreports.html">press
release</ext-link> earlier today, the Nature Publishing Group announced
a new journal that</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>is covering biology, chemistry, earth sciences and physics,</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>is an open access journal, giving the authors the choice of two
    Creative Commons non-commercial licenses,</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>will publish all papers that are judged to be technically valid
    and original, and</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>uses article-level metrics to put the emphasis on the individual
    article rather than the journal as a whole.</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>The new journal is called
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/srep/marketing/index.html"><italic><italic>Scientific
Reports</italic></italic></ext-link>, and obviously resembles
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.plosone.org/"><italic><italic>PLoS
ONE</italic></italic></ext-link> in many ways, down to the
article-processing charges which are $1350 for both journals (but will
go up to $1700 for <italic><italic>Scientific Reports</italic></italic>
in 2012). The journal is open for submissions and will publish the first
papers this summer. With <italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic>,
<italic><italic>Nature Communications</italic></italic> (also see my
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/11/26/nature_communications_interview_with_lesley_anson/">interview</ext-link>
with Chief Editor Lesley Anson) and <italic><italic>Scientific
Reports</italic></italic> the Nature Publishing Group now publishes
three journals covering all areas of the natural sciences.</p>
<p>The launch of <italic><italic>Scientific Reports</italic></italic> is
a good sign that <italic><italic>PLoS ONE</italic></italic> is doing
something right. It will be interesting to watch whether the two
journals will only be competitive – they are aiming for the same
manuscript submissions – or will also collaborate on projects such as
article-level metrics.</p>

  <disp-quote>
    <p>“Scholarly communication has always, will always, and should
    always be served by a mix of models.”</p>
  </disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In another
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/statement.html">press
release</ext-link> today, David Hoole explains the position of the
Nature Publishing Group on open access publishing. He argues that
journals such as <italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic> with a 90%
rejection rates are better served by a subscription model, and that he
feels that journal submission fees (as discussed in a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/12/submission-fees-for-open-access-journals/">recent
report</ext-link>) are not an attractive option. The press release also
mentions that 40% of the content of the hybrid journal
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628140907/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/12/submission-fees-for-open-access-journals/">Nature
Communications</ext-link> is currently open access.</p>
<p>Although I can follow the arguments made in the press release, I
disagree that we need different “tiers” of journals. The
<italic><italic>Scientific Reports</italic></italic> FAQ makes it clear
that the journal doesn’t expect authors to submit their best works, but
rather papers that require “speed of publication”, promise “no
conceptual advance in the field” and show “negative results”. Let’s see
how authors will respond to this and whether it will be possible 10
years from now to distinguish papers published in
<italic><italic>Nature,</italic></italic> <italic><italic>Nature
Communications</italic></italic> and <italic><italic>Scientific
Reports</italic></italic>.</p>
