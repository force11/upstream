<p>Last month at the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2015/pre-conference-meeting-list">Force15
conference</ext-link> in Oxford
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://twitter.com/IanMulvany">Ian
Mulvany</ext-link> and I ran a workshop on
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://martinfenner.ghost.io/2015/01/05/data-citation-support-in-reference-managers/">data
citation support in reference managers</ext-link>. The report of that
workshop isn’t done yet, but I can say that it was a success - we now
have a pretty good idea what the problems are and what needs to be done
to fix them. The short summary of the workshop is in
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://speakerdeck.com/mfenner/workshop-summary-reference-managers-and-data-citation">this</ext-link>
slidedeck of the presentation that summarized the workshop for the other
Force15 attendees.</p>
<p>The whole idea of the workshop was to treat data citation as similar
as possible to the citation of journal articles, i.e. to allow authors
to use the same tools (reference managers) and conventions (citation
styles). Putting a data citation into a reference list makes it easier
to find that data citation because reference lists contain more
metadata, are more structured, and more accessible than data citations
in the form of identifiers or links within the body text of the
article.</p>
<p>But I have to admit that there is one problem with reference lists:
although there is always some self-citation, reference lists usually
contain references to articles (and other resources) created by other
people and before the article was published. It feels a little bit odd
to put a dataset created by the same group of people and published at
the same time into the reference list. And although we could use a
separate reference list or highlight the data associated with the
article in some other way, what we really want is something slightly
different, a manifest file.</p>
<p>The journal article has been a (mainly) textual document for many
centuries not because this is the essence of science communication, but
rather because there was no practical way to include all the other
information (raw data, tools used for experiments, etc.). Very few of
these limitations remain with the digital journal article that we have
since the 1990s, but we have for the most part failed to change the
format other than going from paper to PDF. One of many examples: figures
in publications typically still are has limited as they were decades ago
with no way to see the data underlying the figure, options for selecting
what data points are shown, or animation for time-based information.</p>
<p>So what we really care about is the sum of artifacts and resources
that together make what Carol Goble and others call research object
(Bechhofer et al., 2010), the journal article is an important part, but
clearly doesn’t include everthing that is needed to understand and
reproduce the work. Reference lists can help with linking to some of the
resources not included in the article text, but they typically don’t
link to supplementary information or other places where the underlying
data are made available, or to the figures of the article. Although some
publishers provide navigation tools for readers to get to this
information, what we really need is a machine-readable list of all the
resources used in an article.</p>
<p>As it happens, this is exactly what the ePub format for electronic
books is doing, as every ePub must include a manifest file that lists
all the files that are part of the publication, defined in the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/20/spec/OPF_2.0.1_draft.htm">Open
Packaging Format (OPF)</ext-link>. I need to do more research to figure
out how to do this with
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/index.html">JATS</ext-link>,
the standard for scholarly articles, and how to generate something
similar to the manifest file when using different formats, e.g. html or
markdown. This has to be linked to some of the information we are
collecting already, e.g. described in JATS (Beck, 2011), or the
<monospace>relatedIdentifier</monospace> in the DataCite metadata
(Starr, 2014).</p>
