<p>As we have moved to digital formats both for primary research data
and scientific publications, digital preservation has become critical to
secure permanent access to scientific information. Digital preservation
turned out to be much more difficult than creating digital content, as
preservation requires long-term thinking about many issues including
file formats, storage solutions and funding. Digital preservation turned
out to be too big for individual libraries, publishers or research
disciplines, and large collaborative efforts were started in the last
five years.</p>

  was approved as an ISO standard for long-term archiving of electronic
  documents in 2005. Before PDF/A, many organizations (including our
  institution) used the raster graphics format TIFF. The major advantage
  of the PDF format is the handling text and vector graphics in addition
  to raster images, allowing full-text search and smaller file sizes.
  Because the PDFformat is constantly changing, PDF/A was based on a
  specific PDF version (1.4) with the following specifications:</p>

  <title>Storage solutions</title>
  <p>Hard disks, tape and optical media are possible storage solutions.
  Tape is the ideal solution for long-term storage of research papers,
  but the digital preservation of research data in many areas (e.g.
  sequencing, high-energy physics) can’t be done with tape because of
  the exponential growth of these data. Hard disk storage has another
  problem: the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100405101403/http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/wellcome-trust-sanger-institute-upgrade-sequencing-capacity-unveils-annual-revie">energy
  requirements of data centers</ext-link>.</p>
  <p>We live in a digital world, and this of course includes how we do
  and communicate science. It is surprising that we have barely started
  to think about digital preservation.</p>
