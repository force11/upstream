Barcoding the Native Flowering Plants and Conifers of Wales</ext-link>
has been one of the most popular new <italic>PLoS ONE</italic> papers in
June. In the paper Natasha de Vere <italic>et al.</italic> describe a
DNA barcode resource that covers the 1143 native Welsh flowering plants
and conifers.</p>
<p>My new job as technical lead for the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216233248/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">PLoS
Article Level Metrics (ALM) project</ext-link> involves thinking about
how we can best display the ALM collected for this and other papers. We
want these ALM to tell us something important and/or interesting, and it
doesn’t hurt if the information is displayed in a visually appealing
way. There are many different ways this can be done, but here I want to
focus on <bold>Twitter</bold> and <bold>CiteULike</bold>, the only two
data sources where PLoS is currently storing every single event (tweet
or CiteULike bookmark) with a date. Usage data (HTML and XML views, PDF
downloads) are aggregated on a monthly basis, and PLoS doesn’t store the
publication dates of citations.</p>
<p>We know from the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216233248/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/">work
of Gunter Eysenbach</ext-link> and others that most tweets linking to
scholarly papers are written in the first few days after publication. It
therefore makes sense to display this information on a timeline covering
the first 30 days after publication, and the tweets about the de Vere
paper follow the same pattern.</p>

</fig>
<p>I like the simplicity of sparklines. It would be interesting to also
map the 274 Facebook <bold>Likes, Comments</bold> and
<bold>Shares</bold>, but we don’t have date information for them. The
same is true for the 9 Mendeley readers and groups.</p>
<p>Another way to display the time course of tweets (or bookmarks) is to
use a calendar heat map (the paper was published June 6).</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216233248im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2012/07/calendarPlot.png" xlink:title="calendarPlot" />
</fig>
<p>The chart looks a little bit empty, a calendar heat map probably
works better for information with many daily data points. I would
appreciate feedback on how these visualizations can be improved.</p>
<p>The charts were created with data from the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216233248/http://api.plos.org/">PLoS
ALM API</ext-link> and the statistical computing package
