<p>A year ago today I wrote my first blog post on Nature Network
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/03/open-access-may-become-mandatory-for-nih-funded-research"><bold>Open
access may become mandatory for NIH-funded research</bold></ext-link>).
This is blog post #84 one year later and a good time to reflect on the
experience. In May of last year I started the science blog
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://blog.xartrials.com/"><bold>in
a nutshell</bold></ext-link>, hosted on my own server and written just
for fun. I discovered Nature Network in July and started <bold>Publish
or Perish 2.0</bold>. In November 2007 I
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/11/11/a-case-for-goobledygook"><bold>changed
the blog name</bold></ext-link> to <bold>Gobbledygook</bold>.</p>
<p>I try to write about the paper writing process from the perspective
of a researcher. I’m interested in the technical changes in paper
writing thanks to Web 2.0. Open access is another important topic and
the perspective of a researcher is obviously very different from a
journal publisher, science library or the interested public. I am
sometimes not comfortable to write about open access, as this is a very
political topic and the discussion can move away from arguments and into
something about doing the right thing. That’s why I would never write
about Evolution vs. Intelligent Design or some of the other hotly
debated topics in science blogging.</p>
<p>The blog post that received the most comments is
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/06/14/my-paper-writing-dream-machine-1-0"><bold>My
Paper Writing Dream Machine 1.0</bold></ext-link>. That was also one of
my favorite blog posts as I would love to see more of the potential of
Web 2.0 technologies in our paper writing tools. I also enjoyed the
dicussion on posters at scientific meetings

posters worth the effort?</bold></ext-link>) and on blogging from
conferences
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/05/17/scientific-meetings-need-more-bloggers"><bold>Scientific
meetings need more bloggers</bold></ext-link>).</p>
<p>I participated in a wonderful SynchroBlogging effort on April Fools
Day (organized by
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/"><bold>Jonathan
Eisen</bold></ext-link> and with “help” from the

<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/04/01/what-can-erythopoetin-do-for-you"><bold>What
can Erythopoetin do for you?</bold></ext-link>. I think we should do
more SynchroBlogging, and not just on April 1st. <bold>Public Access
Week</bold> was another SynchroBlogging effort and I learned a lot about
access to my own papers in
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/04/11/public-access-week-who-could-read-my-papers"><bold>Public
Access Week: Who could read my papers?</bold></ext-link>.</p>
<p>Only two blog posts are about scientific research.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033935/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2008/02/07/using-rna-interference-to-identify-genes-that-protect-from-cancer"><bold>Using

models of human cancer and the need for more translational
research</bold></ext-link> I wrote about a presentation by Mario
Capecchi at the International Genetics Conference. I would love to do

but I think that we have to wait a few more years before science
blogging has attracted enough people that read and comment on specific
research findings.</p>
<p>Thanks to this blog I have met a number of very interesting and
intelligent people with similar interests (see

looking forward to the

month. My goal for the next year: help to make reading and writing
science blogs part of the everyday life at more universities and reseach
institutions.</p>
