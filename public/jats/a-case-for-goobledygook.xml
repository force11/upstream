<p>Today I decided to rename my blog from <italic><italic>Publish or
Perish 2.0</italic></italic> to
<italic><italic>Goobledygook</italic></italic>. The old name explained
the topics of this blog pretty well, so why the change after only 4
months of blogging on Nature Network? And there are already
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103739/http://www.technorati.com/blogs/tag/gobbledygook">many
blogs</ext-link> with the same name.</p>
<p>I simply like the new name. The word Goobledygook was invented by the
U.S. congressman Maury Maverick and used in a New York Times
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103739/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40A10F83855157B93C3AB178ED85F408485F9">article</ext-link>
published May 21, 1944. Maury Maverick was fed up with the vague,
pompous and repetitive language used in Washington at the time and
invented this new word for it. He was fighting against the all too
common use of Gobbledygook. The following text is from his New York
Times article:</p>

  <disp-quote>
    <p>Plain and simple speech appeals to everyone because it indicates
    clear thought and honest motives. Here is the point: anyone who is
    thinking clearly and honestly can express his thoughts in words
    which are understandable, and in very few of them. Let's write for
    the reader and not for ourselves. Make the writing do what it is
    intended to.</p>

<p>This text might as well be from a recent editorial about scientific
writing. We had a very lively

about this topic in the <italic><italic>Ask the Nature
Editor</italic></italic> Forum. I first came across the word
Gobbledygook when I

about readability tools. The Nature Literacy Trust has created such a
tool and called it

or Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook.</p>
