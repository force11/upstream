<p>This was the title of the session with <bold><bold>Geoff
Bilder</bold></bold>, <bold><bold>Gudmundur Thorisson</bold></bold> and
myself at the

Online London Conference</ext-link> last Saturday. Geoff first
introduced the ORCID initiative, including these principles:</p>

<p>We then talked about two use cases for ORCID. I started with the
manuscript submission scenario
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525074318/http://www.slideshare.net/mfenner/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy">my
Slideshare presentation</ext-link>), and I suggested that a critical
mass of journals using ORCID would have these benefits to
researchers:</p>
<list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
    <p>Reduced submission work</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Automated CVs and publication lists</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Find related works by author</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Semantic meaning of authorship</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>Semantic meaning of authorship (“corresponding author” or “analyzed
microarray data”) is not a goal for the first ORCID release, but an
interesting future perspective.</p>
<p>Gudmundur followed with a similar presentation about the research
dataset submission scenario
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525074318/http://www.slideshare.net/gthorisson/thorisson-science-online-london-sep2010">his
Slideshare presentation</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The process is similar to journal submission, but interacts with
repositories instead of journals. Gudmundur showed how this workflow
could integrate the submission of a manuscript and the corresponding
research data. He also demonstrated how datasets in repositories
associated with a particular author could be discovered with the help of
ORCID.</p>
<p>But most of the session was dedicated to discussion. As open data was
one of the main themes of the conference, the meaning of “open” in ORCID
was one of the topics. We talked about how the identifier ORCID could be
combined with authentication such as the OAuth system. Phil Lord wanted
a modification of the journal submission use case, in that the ORCIDs of
authors should be provided with the manuscript, and not entered in the
journal submission system. And we talked about whether ORCID should also
be used for blog posts, Wikipedia submissions, Slideshare presentations,
etc. – I argued that not everything needs to be attributed and measured
(see my

<p>Today the ORCID initiative reached another important milestone. ORCID
is
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525074318/http://orcid.org/node/166">now
an official non-profit organization</ext-link> with a first board of
directors. I am looking forward to serve on this board of directors.</p>
