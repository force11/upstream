<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://www.bibtex.org/">BibTeX</ext-link>
is one of the most popular file formats for bibliographies, and is
therefore commonly used to transfer bibliographies from one reference
manager to another, or to other applications that handle bibliographic
references.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://www.refman.com/support/risformat_intro.asp">RIS</ext-link>
and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://www.endnote.com/support/helpdocs/endnote.zip">Endnote
XML</ext-link> are probably the other two bibliographic file formats
most commonly used. Most reference managers support all three formats,
making it easy to move references around.</p>
<p>All three formats have been around for a while, BibTeX for example
since 1985. Reference management has of course gone through many changes
during this time, and an important change will happen next year:
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/orcid/">unique
identifiers for scholarly authors</ext-link>. In 2012 the Open
Researcher &amp; Contributor ID
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</ext-link>)
initiative will start issuing unique identifiers for researchers, and
researchers, universities, funding organizations, publishers and
hopefully everyone else will start using them. But ORCID will only be
successful if as many bibliographic tools as possible can handle ORCID
identifiers, and if these tools can exchange these author
identifiers.</p>
<p>None of the three bibliographic file formats mentioned above can
handle unique author identifiers. If we take for example
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610135415/http://sciencecard.org/articles/d6n">this
paper</ext-link> from ScienceCard, then the authors would look like this
in BibTeX:</p>
<preformat>author = {Kirstein, Janine and Dougan, David and Gerth, Ulf and Hecker, Michael and Turgay, Kürşad}</preformat>
<p>And like this in RIS:</p>
<preformat>AU  - Kirstein, Janine 
AU  - Dougan, David 
AU  - Gerth, Ulf 
AU  - Hecker, Michael 
AU  - Turgay, Kürşad</preformat>
<p>I suggest we extend the BibTeX  format to understand author
identifiers like this:</p>
<preformat>orcid = {1274643, 8474644, 847412, 9183414, 7461414}</preformat>
<p>And RIS:</p>
<preformat>AI  - 1274643 
AI  - 8474644 
AI  - 847412 
AI  - 9183414 
AI  - 7461414</preformat>
<p>This would look similar in Endnote XML. Will we see these changes to
BibTeX, RIS and Endnote XML in 2012? I don’t know, but I very much hope
so. Imagine what your Zotero, Mendeley or Endnote could do if the
application knew about unique author identifiers, e.g. find all papers
by a particular author, alert me when a particular author publishes
something new, or organize your reference library by author.</p>
