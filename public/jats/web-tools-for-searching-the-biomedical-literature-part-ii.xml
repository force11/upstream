<p>Ten days ago I
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/04/29/web-tools-for-searching-the-biomedical-literature-part-i/">mentioned</ext-link>
a paper by Zhiyong Lu that gives an overview over the available web
tools to search the biomedical literature. Most of these tools enhance
the PubMed service, and Zhiyong Lu in fact works for the NCBI, the
developer of PubMed. In this post I want to take a more detailed look at
the available tools.</p>

</fig>
<p>A good starting point is the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114233/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/search/">companion
webpage</ext-link> to the paper, listing 28 services. One of the most
painful shortcomings of PubMed is the sorting of results by date.
Zhiyong lists 8 tools that can present search results sorted by
relevance. Semantic search, seeking relevant concepts, and visualization
of search results are all offered by several tools. Three tools will
identify similar publications, and three tools will find potential
experts, reviewers or collaborators. It is a good sign that there are so
many tools that integrate with PubMed – in addition to the reference
managers (e.g. Endnote, Papers) that do the same.</p>
<p>The analysis has one important shortcoming: only tools that
specifically cover the biomedical literature are discussed. General
purpose search tools such as <bold><bold>Web of Science</bold></bold>,
<bold><bold>Scopus</bold></bold>, <bold><bold>Google
Scholar</bold></bold> or <bold><bold>Microsoft Academic
Search</bold></bold> are therefore not covered, neither are online
bibliographic tools such as <bold><bold>Mendeley</bold></bold> and
<bold><bold>CiteULike</bold></bold>. All of them also include biomedical
literature – although the coverage at the fairly new Microsoft Academic
Search is still limited. They all offer unique features not found in
Pubmed or the 28 tools discussed in the paper.</p>
<p>When I think about how I find interesting articles, then it is
increasingly through my social networks - including this paper by
Zhiyong Lu. His paper unfortunatel fails to discuss this important
search strategy. Twitter, FriendFeed, science blogs, etc. are strange
places to find interesting literature, but they work for me.

April 22 post</ext-link> on the wonderful
<bold><bold>Massgenomics</bold></bold> blog alerted me to two
interesting papers published in JAMA on April 20 that describe the use
of whole-genome sequencing in the care of two patients with acute
leukemia. I presented the paper by Welch et al. in a journal club last
Friday and we had a very interesting discussion.</p>
<p>The paper has also been discussed in the following places:

advertising.</p>
