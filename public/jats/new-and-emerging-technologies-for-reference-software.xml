<p>Jason Rollins gave a presentation with that topic at the recent

<p>Jason talks about some recent trends in reference management
software. For him one important new trend is APIs/extensions. I fully
agree with him, but we havenâ€™t really seen many tools based on these
APIs. Reference managers that provide APIs include

The availability of an API has done a lot for the success of Web 2.0
tools such as Twitter and Flickr.</p>
<p>Another interesting topic was brought up in the discussion: should
reference managers track difference versions of an article (e.g.
pre-print, post-print, publisher PDF)? According to Jason many Endnote
users request this feature. Jason is leading the

development team, but also mentions Mendeley, CiteULike and Papers in
his presentation. I
