<p>Today nature.com

their iPad reader application. The app gives users access to
<italic><italic>Nature News</italic></italic> and abstracts from
<italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic>, <italic><italic>Nature
Genetics</italic></italic>, <italic><italic>Nature
Medicine</italic></italic>, <italic><italic>Nature
Biotechnology</italic></italic>, <italic><italic>Nature
Physics</italic></italic>, <italic><italic>Nature Reviews Microbiology,
Nature Reviews Genetics</italic></italic> and <italic><italic>Nature
Communications</italic></italic>. Full text access to these journals can
be purchased for $69.99 per year
(<italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic> costs $79.99 per year with
free access to fulltext articles until February 28).</p>
<p>The iPad app is in many ways similar to the nature.com iPhone app
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/nature_com_iphone_app_in_pictures/">released
last February</ext-link>, but takes advantage of the larger screen. A
<italic><italic>Nature News</italic></italic> article looks like this on
the website:</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0038-500x375.jpg" xlink:title="IMG_0038" />
</fig>
<p>… and like this in the nature.com reader:</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0037-500x375.jpg" xlink:title="IMG_0037" />
</fig>
<p>Much nicer. The <bold><bold>Add to Connotea</bold></bold> button is
interesting. Connotea is a social bookmarking service by nature.com, but
less popular than CiteULike and Mendeley. So why is there no choice?</p>
<p>The home screen lists all sources and articles. Users can search
nature.com, PubMed and arXiv, but the latter two sources are hidden
behind the <bold><bold>Advanced</bold></bold> button (in the upper right
corner).</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0039-500x375.jpg" xlink:title="IMG_0039" />
</fig>
<p>The saved searches and bookmarks are stored on nature.com and can be
shared with the website and iPhone app. The home screen doesn’t follow
iPad conventions – the sources don’t appear in a floating window when
holding the iPad vertical. Journals can be added here:</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0040-500x375.jpg" xlink:title="IMG_0040" />
</fig>
<p>Journal articles look similar to <italic><italic>Nature
News</italic></italic>. References open in a popup window:</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0042-500x375.jpg" xlink:title="IMG_0042" />
</fig>
<p>Figures open not in a popup, but in a separate window, and they can
be resized. It is unfortunately not possible to scroll through the
figures of a paper.</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0041-500x375.jpg" xlink:title="IMG_0041" />
</fig>
<p>The nature.com reader doesn’t reflow content when you hold the iPad
vertically, just shows less white margin on both sides. Author names are
not links, and for some content the app switches to web browser
mode.</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2011/01/IMG_0043-375x500.jpg" xlink:title="IMG_0043" />

<p>Reading papers on the iPad is much more fun than on the iPhone. And
it was a smart move
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319/http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2010/02/new_naturecom_iphone_app.html">to
use ePub</ext-link> for these mobile apps instead of PDF, I think that
ePub
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">has
a bright future</ext-link> for scholarly content. This is version 1.0,
I’m sure future versions will do further improve the reading experience
thanks to HTML5. The prices for a personal subscription sounds
reasonable, especially for the weekly
<italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic>.</p>
<p>I have one problem with the application: the papers I read are not
all published by Nature Publishing Group. I would very much prefer an
ePub reader for all journal content, similar to the iPad PDF readers
<bold><bold>Sente</bold></bold>, <bold><bold>Papers</bold></bold> and
<bold><bold>Mendeley</bold></bold>. We already have several ePub readers
for the iPad (e.g. Stanza and iBooks), but we need more journal
publishers that offer their content in this format. The
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132319/http://www.nature.com/press_releases/iphone.html">press
release last February</ext-link> hinted that Nature Publishing Group
will provide content in ePub format for other e-readers. Subscription
journals such as the <italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic> journals
have another problem, they want to charge the iPad user for reading
content. This makes it more difficult for them than for open access
publishers to distribute content in innovative ways, and that is
probably one reason the nature.com iPad app is a closed system that
can’t import, export or print articles.</p>
