<p>This blog post is about presentations. And this usually means
PowerPoint presentations, although some people do well without
it<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn1"><bold>1</bold></ext-link></sup>.
Edward Tufte argues that PowerPoint can be a really bad tool to create
slides<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn2"><bold>2</bold></ext-link></sup>.
But it is probably not the software, but rather the people that produce
these slides that are responsible for the
quality<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn3"><bold>3</bold></ext-link></sup>.
The Neurotic Physiology blog published a list of things you shouldn’t do
during a Powerpoint
presentation<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn4"><bold>4</bold></ext-link></sup>.
But there are also many tips to create better presentations. A May 2008

editorial<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn5"><bold>5</bold></ext-link></sup>
gives ten such suggestions. Links to some more Powerpoint tips were
collected in a Nautilus blog

<p>The Nature Network

&amp; Science Forum</bold></ext-link> is a great place for further
discussions.</p>
<p>Presentations can also be created online. Google Docs and Zoho Show
have been around for a while now, but
280Slides<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn7"><bold>7</bold></ext-link></sup>
is a fairly new offering with a very slick interface. The advantages of
these programs: slides can be created by several authors working
together and slides can be easily shared. But presentations created with
Powerpoint can also be shared online. Slideshare and Scribd are the most
popular tools for this, and since last week these presentations can be
embedded into Nature Network blog posts. By default, these presentations
are public and can be seen by everybody. But they can also be uploaded
as private presentations and only those that know the secret URL can see
them. Presentations in the life sciences can also be uploaded to Nature
Preceedings<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn8"><bold>8</bold></ext-link></sup>.
This way the scientific presentation receives a DOI and becomes citable.
But Nature Preceedings has still a long way to go with currently only
about 50 presentations available. Which is a bit suprising, since it
looks like the perfect platform to host conference presentations.</p>
<p>YouTube videos or podcasts are probably the preferred format to share
presentations that also include the recorded audio. Having the audio
available is especially important for those presentations that have
little text on their slides. Many presentations from the TED
(Technology, Entertainment, Design)
conference<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn9"><bold>9</bold></ext-link></sup>
have been made available as TEDTalks, including this one by
Neuroanatomist Jill Bolte Taylor:</p>
<p>If you want to give a presentation remotely (i.e. to one or more
people in a different location), you could use that feature in Google
Docs<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn10"><bold>10</bold></ext-link></sup>.
Or use a full-fledged web conferencing solution such as
Dimdin<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929085351/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/26/new-ways-to-look-at-your-presentation#fn11"><bold>11</bold></ext-link></sup>,

community edition.</p>
