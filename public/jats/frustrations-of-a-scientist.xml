<p>We usually look forward to a well-written paper about central aspects
of your research. But sometimes you are frustrated. Maybe someone has
done (almost) the same experiments, but was quicker in getting the work
published. Then you can at least publish your results, probably in a
less prestigous journal, to confirm these findings.</p>
<p>But when the just published paper comes to the opposite conclusions,
and has done all the right experiments, your work can become almost
worthless. This just happened to me with a

in the December issue of Nature Medicine about the role PPARgamma in
osteoclastogenesis. The group of Ronald Evans used mice with a
conditional knockout of PPARgamma in osteoclasts to study the role of
this nuclear hormone receptor in bone diseases. Their elegant work
clearly shows that PPARgamma promotes osteoclast differentiation and
activation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we have very different results in a tissue culture
model of osteoclast differentiation, consistent with previous
publications. But it is hard to argue with a mouse model. We will
carefully look at the data to decide where we go from here. But for now
it's just frustrating.</p>
