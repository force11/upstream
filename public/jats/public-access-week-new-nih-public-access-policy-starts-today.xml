<p>Around Christmas,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110624/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/12/26/mandatory-open-access-for-nih-funded-research-signed-into-law">mandatory
open access for NIH-funded research</ext-link> was signed into law:</p>
<p specific-use="wrapper">
  <disp-quote>
    <p><italic><italic>The Director of the National Institutes of Health
    shall require that all investigators funded by the NIH submit or
    have submitted for them to the National Library of
    Medicine</italic>'<italic>s PubMed Central an electronic version of
    their final, peer-reviewed manuscripts upon acceptance for
    publication, to be made publicly available no later than 12 months
    after the official date of publication: Provided, That the NIH shall
    implement the public access policy in a manner consistent with
    copyright law.</italic></italic></p>

comments</ext-link> until May 1st for this new policy. Open Access and
this new policy are complicated topics that simply can't be covered in a
single blog post. This week will certainly see a lot of discussion on
this topic, both on Nature Network and elsewhere. Please state your view
on the topic either in blog entries or join the discussion in the

the discussion at the end of this <italic><italic>Public Access
Week</italic></italic>.</p>
