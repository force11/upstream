<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120417213523/http://www.endnote.com/pr-enx1mac.asp">announced</ext-link>
the release of Endnote X1 for Macintosh. New features include
Applescript support, group references and better support for Endnote
Web. Endnote X1 for Windows was released in June. In addition to the
features above, it supports Microsoft Word 2007 and Vista.</p>
<p>Endnote is an essential bibliographic tool for scientific publishing.
New versions are released almost every year (for an overview of the
different versions read

and Endnote is expensive (list price $299), even with educational
discounts. Are there alternatives for Macintosh users?</p>

  Papers can't help with formatting your bibligraphy, but you can export
  your bibliography (e.g. to Endnote).</p>

  is the third reference manager for the Macintosh. I have no real
  personal experience with Bookends, but it also works with Microsoft
  Word and Mellel.</p>
  <p>Most Macintosh users will use Endnote because it is the most mature
  program, and because their collaborators most like also use Endnote.
  But because of the high price tag and the sometimes unelegant
  interface, there might be a market for one of the contenders mentioned
  above. My personal favorite is Papers, so I hope for citation support
  in Papers 2.0.</p>
