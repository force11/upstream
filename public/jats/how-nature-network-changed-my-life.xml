<p>Nature Network turns one year old
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110926/http://blogs.nature.com/nautilus/2008/02/happy_birthday_nature_network.html">today</ext-link>
and it's time to celebrate. We already have a number of interesting –
and entertaining – birthday celebrations. I want to contribute with my
personal experience at Nature Network.</p>
<p>During the day I treat cancer patients and do cancer research at a
German University hospital. But I have been interested in programming
for many years, first with the Applescript language (I was involved with
the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110926/http://www.macscripter.net/">Macscripter</ext-link>
website) and more recently
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110926/http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby
on Rails</ext-link>. Open sharing of resources and information using
blogs and other tools is common in these communities.</p>
<p>I joined Nature Network last August. In May I had started a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110926/http://blog.xartrials.com/">science
blog</ext-link> on my on server, more as a personal experiment than a
serious blogging effort. The inspiration came from an article by Laura
Bonetta published in Cell entitled
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110926/http://www.cell.com/content/article/abstract?uid=PIIS0092867407005430">Scientists
enter the blogosphere</ext-link>. Moving to Nature Network gave me a
much wider audience, but also meant a commitment to a more serious
blogging effort.</p>
<p>The topics I pick for my blog mostly relate to how the internet has
changed the way we publish our scientific work. Writing regular blog
posts about these topics has forced me to do a lot of background
research and I have probably learned more than I would have by just
reading papers and other people's blog posts or comments.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, when Internet use was mostly by dialup and could
cost $10 per hour, I was involved with the Compuserve network. I was an
assistant Sysop with the MacUser Forum and we had message boards, chat
and file downloads.</p>
<p>Nature Network has many of the same features, but with the technology
of the 21st century. The community of fellow

is one big reason to stick around here. Not only did I learn a lot from
others, but is also just fun to learn about

<p>Did Nature Network change my life? At least a little bit already. I
wish Nature Network a happy birthday.</p>
