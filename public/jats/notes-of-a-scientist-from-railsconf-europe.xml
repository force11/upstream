<p>Earlier this month I attended
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101007/http://www.railsconfeurope.com/">RailsConf
Europe</ext-link> in Berlin. RailsConf is a conference about
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101007/http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby
on Rails</ext-link>, a programming framework to produce websites. I'm a
part-time Ruby on Rails programmer and had a very interesting
conference.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611101007/http://chneukirchen.org/blog/archive/2007/09/a-railsconf-europe-07-diary.html">Others</ext-link>
have already written about RailsConf, so I want to focus on how it was
like from a scientist's perspective.</p>
<p>The topic was of course very different from say a meeting about RNA
interference, but many things were surprisingly similar. But I found a
few differences very interesting, and I believe a scientific meeting
could learn from them.</p>
<p>Many of the talks were about ongoing work that hasn't been finished
yet. Ruby on Rails is Open Source software, so there is less worry about
intellectual property and people talked freely about their ideas and
problems. This is in contrast to the typical meeting in my field
(oncology), where only the most established researchers are not afraid
to present data that have not yet been published or at least submitted.
This of course brings us back to the Open Science discussion both on

Network</ext-link> and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Partly because of this openness, but also because it was a technology
meeting, the conference is much more accessible for those that couldn't
make it to Berlin. Not only are the slides of most presentations

for download</ext-link>, but there are also numerous blog posts. We'll
soon also see podcasts and videocasts (the keynote lecture is already

I'm a big podcast fan and I would

to see more of this</ext-link> from the conferences in my field.</p>
