<p>Today is Open Access
Day<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/14/open_access_whats_in_it_for_me/#fn1">1</ext-link></sup>,
intended to broaden awareness and understanding of Open Access. Many
science bloggers have written about Open Access today,and links to a lot
of these blog posts have been collected by Bora
Zivkovic<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/14/open_access_whats_in_it_for_me/#fn2">2</ext-link></sup>

The purchase of <italic><italic>Biomed Central</italic></italic> – the
largest Open Access publisher – by
<italic><italic>Springer</italic></italic> announced last
week<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/14/open_access_whats_in_it_for_me/#fn4">4</ext-link></sup>,
and the announcement of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association
(<italic><italic>OASPA</italic></italic>)
today<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/14/open_access_whats_in_it_for_me/#fn5">5</ext-link></sup>
are strong signs that Open Access has grown up and is no longer new and
experimental. This is probably a good time to give a personal report on
the role of Open Access in my own work, and obviously that perspective
is very different from the perspective of a journal publisher or a
patient
advocate<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/14/open_access_whats_in_it_for_me/#fn6">6</ext-link></sup>.
I wish that more of the discussion would be about practical benefits or
disadvantages for the people involved, rather than using the sometimes
“religious” arguments for or against Open Access.</p>

  <title>Do I have access to the papers I want to read?</title>
  <p>I am in the privileged situation to work for a university hospital
  with institutional subscriptions to most journals I need. From the 10
  journals I read the most (measured by the number of PDFs stored in the
  program
  Papers<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/14/open_access_whats_in_it_for_me/#fn7">7</ext-link>),
  one journal is open access (The Oncologist), three additional journals
  allow free acces after 6-12 months (PNAS, Cancer Research and Blood)
  and one journal is only available through my private subscription
  (Nature Clinical Practice Oncology). I would guess that I have access
  to about 95% of the full-text papers I want to read.</p>

  <title>Can other people read my publications?</title>
  <p>I've blogged about this
  before<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/14/open_access_whats_in_it_for_me/#fn8">8</ext-link></sup>,
  and little has changed in the 6 months since that post. Looking at my
  last 5 papers, only one of them is freely available (because the
  journal allows free access after 12 months), and for one of them even
  my own institution doesn't have access. Good publications are still
  critical to advance my career, so publishing in “good” journals is
  more important to me than publishing in journals where as many people
  as possible can read my papers – and most people interested in my work
  probably also work in institutions with fulltext access. The citation
  advantage of Open Access papers would be an incentive to publish in
  Open Access journals, but to me that question still remains
  unanswered<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/14/open_access_whats_in_it_for_me/#fn9">9</ext-link></sup>.
  I currently have limited research funding, so an Author-pays fee is a
  hurdle for me. I was coauthor of one paper this year that really
  should have been Open Access. It is a detailed guideline on how to
  treat patients with testicular cancer and should have been made freely
  available.</p>

  <p>Most research never gets published and there are many good reasons
  why that is so. But the situation is different for clinical research
  involving the treatment of patients. A clinical trial not only costs a
  lot of money, but is also potentially harmful to a patient. For these
  reasons clinical trials need approval by institutional review boards
  and other institutions before they are even started, acting as a sort
  of peer review at the beginning. And the desired endpoint for a
  clinical trial is not necessarily a publication, but rather the
  approval of a new drug. A recent <italic><italic>PLoS
  Medicine</italic></italic> paper found that only 43% of the clinical
  trials used for approval of drugs by the American Food and Drug
  Administration (FDA) were later
  published<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/14/open_access_whats_in_it_for_me/#fn10">10</ext-link></sup>.
  And many other clinical trials with negative results not even appear
  in the documents submitted for drug approval, meaning that these data
  are lost forever. This so-called publication bias creates many
  problems, and is unfortunately encouraged my most journals.
  Fortunately this situation has recently changed. Clinical trials must
  be registered in public databases since 2005, and since last month the
  main results also have to be published in the public database once the
  trial has been
  completed<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003084018/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/14/open_access_whats_in_it_for_me/#fn11">11</ext-link></sup>.</p>
