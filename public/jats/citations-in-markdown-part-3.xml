<p>After the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/19/citations-in-scholarly-markdown/">post
last week</ext-link> and the crazy discussion that followed I would
understand that you feel you have heard enough about citations in
markdown. But I had the feeling last week that something was still
missing, and I have done some more thinking. What we have so far:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>Pandoc has nice support for citations, including Citation Style
    Language support (i.e. it is using the same 5000+ citation styles as
    Zotero, Mendeley and Papers).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Pandoc requires a separate file to store the citations, typically
    in bibtex format. This is fine for some people, but can make the
    workflow complicated for short documents or when several people work
    on the bibliography at the same time.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Citations are similar to links, and we can use links for almost
    all the functionality we need, making it much easier to add
    citations to a text. The problem is a) citations that don’t include
    a weblink, b) being able to do this offline, and c) where in the
    HTML to store the citation metadata.</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>And I looked at how Wikipedia is
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources">doing
this</ext-link>, and they use a) links, b) citations and c) footnotes.
If Wikipedia thinks that it can’t do without citations and do everything
as links, then maybe we also shouldn’t enforce this for scholarly
texts.</p>
<p>I think what we need is the best of both worlds. We should use the
Pandoc citation workflow, as it is similar to what we are used to from
other authoring environments, and we get good citation style support,
including more complex formatting of references. Some reference managers
already support copy/paste of Pandoc citation keys. The inclusion of a
bibtex file with a scholarly markdown text is also a bonus, as it allows
the automated extraction of citations, e.g. by manuscript submission
systems.</p>
<p>We also want to support a simpler solution for shorter texts or when
people don’t want to use a separate bibtex file. Here we would add the
citations as links, ideally in a syntax very similar to Pandoc citation
keys:</p>
<preformat>Johnson [@Johnson2006] didn't agree with ...

[@Johnson2006]: http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aris.201 &quot;Data sharing in the sciences&quot;</preformat>
<p>We need to write a tool that parses the markdown before Pandoc,
fetches the citation metadata for these links in bibtex format (e.g.
using CrossRef Content Negotiation), and adds them to the existing
bibtex file (or creates a new bibtex file). The next time the markdown
is parsed, the citation is already “cached” in the bibtex file. Those
people who don’t have such a tool would see the citation as link
(<bold><bold>???</bold></bold>), with the essential information (DOI or
URL) preserved so that a downstream tool can fetch the bibliographic
information. Some people were worried about typos in DOIs and URLs. They
can add additional information - e.g. the title of the paper - in double
quotes to allow checking of the correct DOI.</p>
<p>This workflow now makes a lot of sense to me, as it uses existing
solutions, but also allows for easy entering of citation information in
a way similar to the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carlboettiger.info/2012/05/30/knitcitations.html">knitcitations</ext-link>
and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/kcite/">kcite</ext-link>
tools. As I use jekyll and am a Ruby developer, I will implement the
citation parsing as a jekyll plugin.</p>
