in late November. Back in June I

about</ext-link> the first public version of Annotum, but until now
using Annotum was experimental. Annotum is available in the

Themes Directory</ext-link> at WordPress.org (and has been downloaded
more than 9,000 times in the past three weeks), and is also available
for users of WordPress.com. I have installed Annotum 1.0

please drop me a note if you want an account.</p>
<p>But how is an Annotum blog different from a regular WordPress
blog?</p>
<sec id="annotum-is-a-wordpress-theme">
  <title>Annotum is a WordPress Theme</title>
  <p>WordPress can be extended via Plugins and Themes. Whereas Plugins
  add functionality, themes usually change the look and feel of a
  WordPress site. Annotum is a theme that includes a lot of plugin
  functionality. This strategy makes it easier to get started with
  Annotum, as there is only one theme to install and not a set of
  plugins that has to work with a particular theme. Annotum can still be
  extended via
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">child
  themes</ext-link>, e.g. if you want a different look for your blog.
  And of course you can still use other scholarly plugins.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="annotum-uses-articles-and-not-posts">
  <title>Annotum uses articles and not posts</title>
  <p>Annotum uses the custom post type
  <italic><italic>article</italic></italic> for scholarly content. This
  can be confusing in the beginning, but makes it easier to separate
  scholarly content from regular blog posts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="the-annotum-editor-knows-about-document-structure">
  <title><bold><bold>The Annotum editor knows about document
  structure</bold></bold></title>
  <p>Scholarly articles have more structure than blog posts, and you can
  add this structure with the Annotum editor (see below). This structure
  is enforced, and the WordPress HTML editor is disabled. This makes it
  easier to create content that conforms to the NLM-DTD XML format.</p>

  <title>Annotum can import and export in the NLM-DTD format</title>
  <p>More specifically, Annotum supports the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/ncbi/kipling/">Kipling
  subset</ext-link> of the NLM Journal Publishing DTD. NLM-DTD is the
  standard XML format for scholarly articles, and you can for example
  import published articles (with a license that allows reuse) into
  Annotum to get started. Unfortunately there aren’t that many NLM-DTD
  tools for authors (I haven’t tested
  the<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120421012848/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2008/11/07/interview-with-pablo-fernicola">Microsoft
  Word Article Authoring Add-In</ext-link> with Annotum), but this is a
  great way to get content written somewhere else into Annotum.</p>

<sec id="annotum-knows-that-articles-can-have-multiple-authors">
  <title>Annotum knows that articles can have multiple authors</title>
  <p>This is of course important for scholarly articles, and the

<sec id="annotum-knows-about-tables-figures-equations-and-references">
  <title>Annotum knows about tables, figures, equations and

  <p>Scholarly articles have special formatting requirements for these
  content types, particularly references. Annotum adds visual editors
  for all of them. Annotum also has an editor for LaTeX equations.</p>

  <p>Annotum currently does not integrate with reference managers
  (Endnote, Mendeley, Zotero, etc.) or other WordPress tools that insert
  citations into blog posts (e.g

  <title>Annotum knows about reviewers and editors</title>
  <p>Annotum has  a built-in review system that knows about authors,

  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Annotum is a complete and free solution for starting a scholarly
  journal using WordPress. It has everything you need to write great
  scholarly content with WordPress and improves a regular WordPress blog
  in several important ways. Thanks to the support for the NLM-DTD
  format, Annotum can also be used as a writing tool for articles
  intended for submission somewhere else. One of the biggest strengths
  of WordPress is that it is really a writing
  <italic><italic>platform</italic></italic> that can be extended in
  many interesting ways. Maybe we will see WordPress plugins that
  enhance the equation editor or the reference management – or that
  connect Annotum to traditional journal submission systems.</p>
  <p>Science bloggers will also be interested in many of the features of
  Annotum, but they don’t need the review workflow and might find that
  the support for NLM-DTD restricts them in how they can write content.
  Annotum is at version 1.0, and it is therefore not surprising that it
  still has a few rough edges. My biggest wish for a future version is
  better support for revisions and inline comments – Google Docs and
  other collaborative writing tools do a much better job highlighting
  the changes made in a text.</p>
