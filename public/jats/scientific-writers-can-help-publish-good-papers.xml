<p>Advice by your supervisor,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092138/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/09/30/books-about-scientific-writing">books</ext-link>,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092138/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/11/26/can-a-workshop-improve-your-scientific-writing">workshops</ext-link>
and <italic><italic>a lot</italic></italic> of experience can improve
the quality of your scientific writing. But when you are about to submit
your paper and don't want to take any chances – especially when English
is not your first language – a scientific writer can be helpful. You can
pay someone to do this, but even better would be a scientific writer
that is employed by your university or research organization (I've
written about this
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092138/http://network.nature.com/topics/show/567?page=2">before</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Not many institutions in Germany have the resources (or vision) to
hire such a person. I was therefore glad to see a job posting for a
scientific writer at the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092138/http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/">Max
Planck Institute for Infection Biology</ext-link> in Berlin, Germany.
More institutions, including of course my own university, should follow
this example. (Disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with the Max Planck
Institute in any way. I worked across the street for five years).</p>
