this week's reaction of the blogosphere. I would like to highlight some
of the discussions we had here on Nature Network.</p>
<p>Bob O'Hara wonders about the cost of publishing in
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110656/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/boboh/2008/04/09/open-access-show-us-the-money">Open
Access: Show us the Money!</ext-link>. He argues that shifting the costs
from reader to author can create problems. Most authors, especially
those with limited resources, would be reluctant to pay submision fees
if they can also submit to a journal without those fees. But the
reader-pays model could give authors more bargaining power with
journals. The post created an interesting discussion about the different
aspects of publishing costs</p>
<p>Graham Steel pointed out the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110656/http://network.nature.com/forums/harvardpublishingforum/1331">Second
European Conference on Scientific Publishing in Biomedicine and
Medicine</ext-link> that takes place in Oslo September 4-6 in Oslo,
Norway. The conference focusses on open access and bibliometrics.</p>
<p>I wrote two blog posts about public access. In Germany, most research
organizations have signed the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110656/http://oa.mpg.de/openaccess-berlin/berlindeclaration.html">Berlin
Declaration</ext-link>, but in contrast to the new NIH policy, there is
no mandatory public access. In another blog entry, I looked at public
access to my own research papers – most of them are only accessible for
those with institutional journal subscriptions.</p>
<p>What is the next step for me? That I need to learn more about
self-archieving – both the policies of the journals I have published and
the institutional repository at my university.</p>
