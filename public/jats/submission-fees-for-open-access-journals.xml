<p>Submission fees are more common than I thought, particularly in
economics and the life sciences. The American Physiological Society
journals, <italic><italic>Cancer Research</italic></italic>,
<italic><italic>FASEB Journal</italic></italic>, <italic><italic>Journal
of Clinical Investigation</italic></italic>, <italic><italic>Journal of
Immunology</italic></italic> and <italic><italic>Journal of
Neuroscience</italic></italic> all charge submission fees between $50
and $100, the <italic><italic>Journal of Biological
Chemistry</italic></italic> dropped the $60 submission fee in 2010. Most
journals that charge submission fees are society journals.</p>
<p>The report finds that submission fees would be particularly
interesting for Open Access journals with high rejection rates (70% and
more), as this would greatly reduce the article-procesing charges for
accepted manuscripts. A journal that accepts 10% of submitted papers
could use a $150 submission fee to reduce the fee for accepted
manuscripts from $2500 to $1150. There wouldn’t really be a price
reduction for journals that accept 50% of submitted papers.</p>
<p>Mark Ware reports that the Open Access publishers he talked to
weren’t really interested in starting submission fees for their
journals, mainly because of the risks involved in changing their
business model. I personally believe that submission fees may be the
only option for journals with high rejection rates to become Open Access
journals (unless you want to cross-subsidize those journals). I like
submission fees because they help to cover the actual costs involved,
instead of the costs of handling manuscripts that are ultimately
rejected being paid either by journal subscribers or the authors of
accepted manuscripts.</p>
