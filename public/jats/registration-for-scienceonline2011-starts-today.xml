<p>Registration for the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185427/http://scienceonline2011.com/">ScienceOnline2011</ext-link>
conference starts today at 12 noon EST. This is the fifth annual
conference on science and the web, and will be held January 13-15, 2011
in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.</p>

<p>This is the second time I will go to the conference – I had a
wonderful time in 2009. The discussion around the 2009 session
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185427/http://jdupuis.blogspot.com/2009/01/scienceonline-09-sunday-summary-and.html">Reputation,
Authority and Incentives</ext-link> (moderated by Björn Brembs and Pete
Binfield) was really the starting point for my interest in unique
researcher identifiers. The conference was also the first time that I
met PLoS Blogs partner
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185427/http://blogs.plos.org/takeasdirected/">David
Kroll</ext-link> and many other great people.</p>
<p>You will find my name on the

program</ext-link> in a session <bold><bold>Having Fun with
Citations</bold></bold> (together with Melody

    <p><italic><italic>Citations play a central role in science
    communication, but their role in the traditional scientific
    publication is often rather boring. We love to count citations for
    measures of scientific impact, but we spend little time thinking
    about the context and meaning of citations. In this session I would
    like to talk about topics ranging from semantic meaning of citations
    (using CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology by David Shotton),
    citations of retracted papers, citations of datasets (using
    Datacite), the importance of an Open Bibliography, formatting of
    citations using CSL (Citation Style Language), citations in Twitter
    and other unusual places, citation mutations and the integration of
    unique researcher identifiers (using ORCID)</italic><italic>. There
    is some interesting work on how citation rates follow Zipfian-like
    distributions; it would be interested to discuss the background and
    implications.</italic></italic></p>
  </disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The exact session format and the other session moderators have not
been finalized. There are also at least two related session proposals:
<bold>How is the Web changing the way we identify scientific
impact?</bold> (Jason Priem, Paul Groth) <bold><bold></bold></bold> and
<bold><bold>The Digital Toolbox: What’s Needed?</bold></bold> (Kaitlin
Thaney) – we might combine some of our ideas. And of course I am also
looking forward to again meet all these wonderful people that are
interested in science and the web.</p>
