  <p>You want to regularly go through the papers published in the most

  <p>Subscribe to the journal table of contents (TOC) RSS feed. Almost
  all journals now provide their TOC as RSS feed that is updated with
  every new issue.
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</ext-link>
  is a standard web format used to publish frequently updated works. A
  journal article RSS feed usually contains one item for every article,
  each with title, authors, abstract and link to the fulltext article.
  To subscribe to the RSS feed of the journal TOC, look out for the RSS
  icon</p>

  </fig>
  <p>at the table of contents page. Links to the RSS feeds of some
  popular scientific journals are:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss">Nature</ext-link></p>

      of the National Academy of Sciences</ext-link></p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>Although most web browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer 7, Firefox or
  Safari) will understand RSS feeds (so you can just click on the links
  provided above), you should use a dedicated RSS reader if you
  subscribe to more than a few RSS feeds. There are web-based RSS
  readers
  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.google.com/reader">Google
  Reader</ext-link> and
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</ext-link>
  are popular choices) and dedicated programs for
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Internet/Clients/WWW/Feed_Readers/">every
  platform</ext-link> (e.g.
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/feeddemon/default.aspx">FeedDemon</ext-link>
  for Windows or
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</ext-link>
  for Macintosh).</p>
  <p>Dedicated RSS readers have two important features: they keep track
  of the journal articles you have already
  <italic><italic>read</italic></italic>, and they allow you to
  <italic><italic>mark</italic></italic> interesting articles for late
  use: reading the full-text article (online or after printing the PDF),
  and storing the article in your reference manager of choice.</p>
  <p>RSS readers are also available for mobile devices such as the
  <italic><italic>iPhone</italic></italic> and are great for quickly
  going through a journal table of contents on the way to work.</p>

  <title>Discussion</title>
  <p>Regular reading of journal table of contents in your field
  (browsing) is still an important way to keep up with the literature,
  even though the use of online databases to find specific articles
  (searching) has become more common in recent years.</p>
  <p>Some people prefer to regularly flip through the printed journal
  when the latest issue arrives. But not only is there a delay between
  electronic publication and arrival of the printed journal, but most
  individuals can't afford to personally subscribe to more than a few
  journals at most. And looking at the printed copy subscribed to by the
  department or library is often no longer practical to do on a regular
  basis.</p>
  <p>Receiving the journal TOC by
  <italic><italic>email</italic></italic> is a popular alternative, but
  has several disadvantages:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p>Receiving the TOC by email requires a few extra steps,
      including providing your email address, and often signing up for a
      (free) account with the journal</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Organizing the TOC emails with your email program (e.g. moving
      to appropriate subfolders) requires extra work</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Marking an interesting article for later reading requires extra
      work, because the TOC is sent in one big email message</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Sharing the TOC with coworkers is more difficult than with RSS
      feeds</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>Because RSS is a universal computer-readable format, receiving the
  journal TOC can easily be extended. One example would be the
  integration of the journal RSS feeds into reference managers.
  <italic><italic>CiteULike</italic></italic> has this feature (e.g. the
  most recent issue of
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.citeulike.org/journal/nature">Nature</ext-link>),
  but I hope that more reference managers will do the same in the
  future.</p>
  <p>Although almost all journals now provide RSS feeds to their TOC,
  how they do it might differ. Not every journal RSS feed uses the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174136/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</ext-link>
  â€“ now the preferred way to link to a journal article. There are also
  small differences in what information is provided in the RSS feed.</p>
