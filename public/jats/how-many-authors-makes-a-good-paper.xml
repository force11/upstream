post</ext-link>, talks about author accountability. The article suggests
that at least one author per collaborative group signs a statement with
reference to Nature's

policies</ext-link>. This policy would certainly help avoid
<italic><italic>honorary authorship</italic></italic>, but it can be
difficult to enforce in large research projects.</p>
<p>I would like to make another suggestion. The quality of a research
paper should not only be judged by the number of citations it receives
(which improves the

number</ext-link> of the author), but also by the number of authors.
There are of course research projects that are only possible with large
numbers of collaborators, but many biomedical papers probably only need
2-4 authors, but rather have 5-8 authors.</p>
<p>One good rule of thumb is a number of papers published per year. If
that number is too high (e.g. more than 10), then the author has
probably not contributed significantly to all those papers. Department
heads often fall into this category. These rules can easily be applied
when reviewing job or grant applications.</p>

sugar in diabetics. John MacLeod was not a coauthor, but rather thanked
in the acknowledgements. As head of the department he provided mainly
logistical support. He still went on to
