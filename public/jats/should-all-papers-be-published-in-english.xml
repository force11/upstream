<p>The

Ã„rzteblatt</ext-link> is the official journal of the German Medical
Association, just as the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092755/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/01/16/should_all_papers_be_published_in_english/http.//ww.bmj.com">British
Medical Journal</ext-link> (BMJ) and the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092755/http://jama.ama-assn.org/">Journal
of the American Medical Association</ext-link> (JAMA). Starting January
21, an
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092755/http://www.aerzteblatt-international.de/">English
language version</ext-link> of the journal will be available.</p>
<p>The publisher and editors of the journal decided to make this step to
have the journal articles better indexed in databases such as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092755/http://www.pubmed.gov/">PubMed</ext-link>
and available to more readers. This should lead to more citations of
journal articles, resulting in a better Impact Factor and reputation of
the journal.</p>
<p>100 years ago, German was an important scientific language, but now
only 2% of journals indexed in Medline are in German. I personally
haven't written a scientific paper in German in for many years. I
sometimes regret that I can't use German (or French or Italian for that
matter) to report by findings or express my ideas. But in the end it
makes the exchange of ideas between scientists much easier if we can all
use the same language. And Nature Network is a good example for
this.</p>
