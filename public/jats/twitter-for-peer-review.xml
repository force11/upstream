<p>A recent <italic><italic>Nature News</italic></italic> article by
Geoff Brumfiel
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090318/full/458274a.html">Science
journalism: Supplanting the old media?</ext-link>) has stirred up many
interesting discussions about the relationship of science blogging and
traditional science journalism. Good starting places to follow these
discussions (and engage in them) are

Blogs</ext-link> and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://friendfeed.com/e/4f3817ea-f82c-3a94-4e1c-3368926a24ed/Defining-the-Journalism-vs-Blogging-Debate-with-a/">FriendFeed</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Science blogging extends, but also threatens traditional science
journalism. At the same time, aggregators and microblogging services
such as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://www.friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</ext-link>,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</ext-link>,
but also
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</ext-link>
also are both an enhancementent and a threat to science blogs. Instead
of writing blog posts or commenting on them, many science bloggers spend
increasing amounts of time with these services, e.g. in
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://friendfeed.com/rooms/the-life-scientists">The
Life Scientists</ext-link> room on FriendFeed.</p>
<p>But microblogging and aggregation services have also emerged as new
tools for another area of science communication, namely the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://www.nature.com/nature/peerreview/debate/index.html">peer
review</ext-link> process. The interaction between authors and editors
or editors and reviewers traditionally happens via email (because peer
review is usually anonymous, authors don't communicate directly with
reviewers). Twitter and similar tools fullfill the requirement for
privacy (in the form of direct messages and private rooms and special
services for organizations such as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</ext-link>).</p>
<p>What are the advantages of these tools for the peer review process?
All communications can be stored in one place in the form of a
discussion thread. FriendFeed and Facebook allow users to mark posts
they like and this can show agreement between reviewers. Messages can
also be sent to and from non-traditional devices such as cell phones.
Many senior researchers are already overworked with peer review, so this
way they can at least post their reviews from the golf course or their
yacht. And authors want to learn about their accepted paper as soon as
possible, and this is not necessarily when they sit in front of their
computer.</p>
<p>But most importantly, microblogging enforces brevity. Virginia Walbot
recently complained in a <italic><italic>Journal of
Biology</italic></italic> comment
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053130/http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/jbiol125">Are
we training pit bulls to review our manuscripts?</ext-link>) about
reviewers</p>

</p>
<p>As Twitter messages (also known as tweets) can only be 140 characters
long, reviewers are forced to write short reviews, and editors to write
short notes to the authors. And if the 140 characters aren't enough,
they can always point to other places with services like
