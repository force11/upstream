<p>All science bloggers do a lot of reading for background information,
or write blog posts based on a (newly published) paper, blog post or
news item. So I thought that it would be a good idea to collect those
references in a single place.</p>

<p>Reading lists are perfect for this, and they are easy to create and
maintain with web-based reference managers. Reading lists are used in
teaching, e.g. to provide a list of required reading material for a
class. But I can also see a number of benefits for science blogs:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>they help the blogger to organize his background material for
    writing</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>they help the reader find and keep referenced material</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>they can provide additional reading not mentioned in the blog
    post</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>There are several good tools for reading lists. I decided to use
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</ext-link>,
because what I really want here is a social bookmarking tool that
understands references. My Goobledygook reading list is
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/group/13987/library">here</ext-link>,
the RSS feed is
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604134625/http://www.citeulike.org/rss/group/13987/library">here</ext-link>,
and the most recent items in the reading list are also shown in a new
sidebar to the right. I started with references to papers, but plan to
also include blog posts and other web resources.</p>
