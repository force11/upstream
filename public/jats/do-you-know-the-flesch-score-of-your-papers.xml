<p>We just had a very interesting discussion in the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630154317/http://network.nature.com/forums/askthenatureeditor/567">Ask
the Nature Editor</ext-link> Forum about scientific writing. Most people
agreed that the quality of the writing in the end doesn't really
influence the decision to accept or reject a paper. But good writing,
especially in the first paragraph, certainly helps.</p>
<p>But what is good scientific writing? Two weeks ago I suggested a few
good books on the subject in a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630154317/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/09/30/books-about-scientific-writing">blog
post</ext-link>. Once you have written the paper using the advice in
these books, you can use a number of tools to measure the readability of
your paper.</p>
<p><italic><italic>Flesch Reading Ease Score</italic></italic>:</p>
<p specific-use="wrapper">
  <disp-quote>
    <p>206.835 - 1.015 x ASL - 84.6 x ASW</p>
  </disp-quote>
</p>
<p>ASL is average sentence length and ASW is average number of syllables
per word. The Flesch Reading Ease Score can be between 0 and 100, 100
being the most difficult.</p>
<p>The <italic><italic>Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Test</italic></italic>
is similar, but rates the text on a U.S. school grade level. Both Flesch
scores are built into recent versions of Microsoft Word or you could use
the Open Source application
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630154317/http://flesh.sourceforge.net/">Flesh</ext-link>.
Flesh is much easier to use than the Microsoft Word tool and will also
open PDF files. Try to rewrite your manuscript if your Flesch Reading
Ease Score is too low, e.g. below 30.</p>
<p>Readability is important not only for manuscripts. Informed consent
forms for patients wishing to participate in clinical trials in Medicine
are often

to read</ext-link>. And a perspective article by Celeste Condit in the
current <italic><italic>Nature Reviews Genetics</italic></italic> talks
about

geneticists can help reporters to get their story right</ext-link>. She
points out the importance of readability to communicate often highly
technical material to lay people.</p>
