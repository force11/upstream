Griffiths</ext-link> gave an interesting presentation with the above
title. He identified 12 possible reasons why students have problems
learning genetics. His main argument: students should learn concepts and
principles and apply them creatively in novel situations (the

details are often crammed into seminars and textbooks. In other words,
students often stay at the lowest level of

the creation of new knowledge, is seldom reached, although these skills
are of course critical for a successful researcher.</p>

talked about the teaching of genetics in the classroom. He was concerned
that a survey found that molecular evolution (or molecular phylogeny)
was taught in not more than 30% of European classrooms. He gave some
examples of how principles of genetics can be integrated into high
school teaching.</p>

biology students as teachers. Interestingly, they have not only taught
high school students, but also journalists and â€“ priests (German
