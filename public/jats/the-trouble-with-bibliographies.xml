<p>The bibliography of a scholarly paper is interesting and important
reading material. You can see whether the authors have cited the
relevant literature, and you often find references to interesting papers
you didn’t know about. Bibliographies are obviously also needed to count
citations, and then do all kinds of useful and not so useful things with
them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately almost all bibliographies are in the wrong format. What
you want is at least a direct link to the cited work using the DOI (if
available), and a lot of journals do that. You don’t want to have a link
to PubMed using the PubMed ID as the only option (as in PubMed Central),
as this requires a few more mouse clicks to get to the full-text
article. And you don’t want to go to an extra page, then use a link to
search the PubMed database, and then use a few more mouse clicks to get
to the full-text article (something that could happen to you with a PLoS
journal).</p>
<p>A bibliography should really be made available in a downloadable
format such as BibTeX. Unfortunately journal publishers – including Open
Access publishers – in most cases don’t see that they can provide a lot
of value here without too much extra work. One of the few publishers
offering this service is BioMed Central – feel free to mention other
journals that do the same in the comments.</p>
<p>This weekend
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610124417/http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/03/04/scholarly-html-hackfest-and-visit-of-peter-sefton-and-martin-fenner/">Peter
Murray-Rust invited Peter Sefton and me to Cambridge</ext-link> (UK) for
a very interesting workshop about <bold><bold>Scholarly
HTML</bold></bold>. Our goal is to discuss how we can define standards
and build tools to make HTML the best platform for scholars and
scholarly works. The event is in fact a hackfest, and we hope to have
something to show by Sunday evening.</p>
<p>My idea for the hackfest is a tool that extracts all links
(references and weblinks) out of a HTML document (or URL) and creates a
bibliography. The generated bibliography should be both in HTML (using
the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610124417/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/24/citation-style-language-an-interview-with-rintze-zelle-and-ian-mulvany/">Citation
Style Language</ext-link> ) and BibTex formats, and should ideally also
support the Citation Typing Ontology

and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610124417/http://ocoins.info/">COinS</ext-link>
-  a standard to embed bibliographic metadata in HTML. I will use PHP as
a programming language and will try to build both a generic tool and
something that can work as a WordPress plugin. Obviously I will not
start from scratch, but will reuse several already existing libraries.
Any feedback or help for this project is much appreciated.</p>
<p>If I had a tool with which I could create my own bibliographies (and
in the formats I want), I would no longer care so much about journals
not offering this service. One big problem would still persist, and that
is that most subscription journals wouldn’t allow the redistribution of
the bibliographies to their papers. A single citation can’t have a
copyright, but a compilation of citations can. I’m sure we will also
discuss this topic at the workshop, as Peter Murray-Rust is one of the
biggest proponents of
