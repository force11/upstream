was announced. PRISM is a lobbying organisation created by the
Professional &amp; Scholarly Publishing Division
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120412202205/http://www.pspcentral.org/">PSP</ext-link>)
of the Association of American Publishers
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120412202205/http://www.publishers.org/">AAP</ext-link>).
The main purpose of PRISM appears to lobby legislators in Washington to
not
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120412202205/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/03/open-access-may-become-mandatory-for-nih-funded-research">sign
legislation</ext-link> that would require public access to all
scientific papers within 12 months after publication.</p>
<p>While there are many good arguments for or against this change in
legislation, and you would expect many AAP members to oppose this
measure, PRISM is different in that it is a pure lobbying effort – e.g.

vs. fact: Setting the Record Straight on Scholarly Journals</ext-link>.
The two main arguments used are:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>open access undermines the peer review process</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>requiring deposition in public repositories leads to government
    interference in scientific publishing</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>These “arguments” were obviously created in a PR department, as they
don't make sense to anybody involved in scientific publishing. The peer
review process is not different in open access journals. And to call
deposition of NIH-funded research papers in the NIH-managed PubMed
Central “government interference” is difficult to understand.</p>
<p>PRISM might be successful in avoiding a change in U.S. legislation,
but the strange logic used by PRISM could lead many scientists to think
twice before submitting a paper to a journal that endorses the PRISM
principles. Which in the end could be worse for the journal publisher
than the proposed change in legislation.</p>
