<p>Both Adobe and Microsoft today announced free web-based solutions for
document sharing.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630153745/http://share.adobe.com/">Adobe
Share</ext-link> uses the Flash technology to display various document
formats.

O'Reilly</ext-link> has a nice writeup of the new service.</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630153745/http://workspace.officelive.com/">Microsoft
Office Live Workspace</ext-link> allows the sharing of Microsoft Office
documents. Just as with Adobe Share, and in contrast to
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630153745/http://docs.google.com/">Google
Docs</ext-link>, you can't directly edit documents online.</p>
<p>Why should a scientist care about all this? Because these are
excellent tools to share your presentations and to collaborate on
manuscripts you are writing. No more emailing Powerpoint, Excel, Word or
PDF files back and forth. And with several major players (Microsoft,
Google, Adobe and the smaller

offering web-based document sharing, this will soon become as
commonplace as web-based email.</p>
<p>In related news, Adobe today also announced the acquisition of
Buzzword, the online word processor that I wrote about
