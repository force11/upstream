<p>At the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.digital-science.com/events/scifoo-camp-2015/">SciFoo
Camp</ext-link> this weekend
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://emckiernan.wordpress.com/">Erin
McKiernan</ext-link> and I moderated an unconference session on the
topic <bold>Why should we work where we live?</bold> This was a
spontaneous idea after we had talked about this topic on Friday (Erin
lives in Mexico with a job in Canada, I live in Germany and work for an
organization in San Francisco).</p>
<p>We quickly realized that this situation is far from uncommon in the
space we work in (science and science communication). Most commonly the
reason is compromises we have to make when both partners have to find an
adequate job. It can be a big challenge for a couple to find senior jobs
in academia in the same city or region, especially outside of academic
clusters such as Boston, New York or London.</p>
<p>The other big reason for work remote is that some research can only
happen in special places, for example in high-energy physics, astronomy
or the geosciences. And of course there are other flavors of the same
situation, e.g. when a principal investigator moves to a new institution
and PhD students or postdocs can’t or don’t want to move with him/her.
And most academics have to do at least some remote work, since they will
spend a good amount of time travelling to conferences or collaboration
partners.</p>
<p>The discussion in the session centered on the social and technical
challenges of working remotely. We didn’t have time to go into the legal
aspects (e.g. taxes when you work in a different country), or the
challenges organizing your personal life, particular difficult when you
have children.</p>
<p>We shared our experience with online collaboration tools, and video
conferencing with Skype, Google Hangouts or similar was central to this.
Videoconferencing can be a challenge with slow internet connectivity, a
situation that luckily is constantly improving.</p>
<p>Private group chat tool such as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.hipchat.com/">HipChat</ext-link>
or
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://slack.com/">Slack</ext-link>
are becoming increasingly popular outside the Tech sector and are a
great alternative to email. They not only provide a platform for quick
messages between two people, but also serve as a backchannel for
informal “water cooler” discussions in an organization.</p>
<p>Another essential category is tools that track your work so that your
remote colleagues not only can collaborate with you, but also see the
work you are doing. As a supervisor you quickly see the work that was
done the past week, a much more reasonable approach than looking at
physical presence at work (where people might be doing all kinds of
other things and personal productivity varies). Tracking your work is
easy if you are a software developer like me and can look at code
commited to version control, tickets closed, etc. For research this is
more challenging, in particular if the workflow is not digital yet and
for example all experiments are documented in a paper notebook. It seems
that one requirement for remote work in science is digitalization of
your work, but that is a direction we are heading anyway and which has
other advantages (e.g. improving reproducibility). If there are no
specialized tools for documenting your work available, then a
note-taking tool such as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.onenote.com/">OneNote</ext-link>
or
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</ext-link>
can be helpful. The digitization and automation of work is obviously
limited in wet labs that require direct interactions with samples and
instruments.</p>
<p>The social aspects of remote work might be the bigger challenge.
There is still a big reluctance in supervisors and administrators to
this, assuming that people will only be productive if someone is
watching them. This assumption is very short sighted, as what drives
PhDs and postdocs to work hard is not supervision, but the intrinsic
motivation to accomplish something, in particular in light of the very
competitive situation for permanent jobs in academia. The book
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://37signals.com/remote/">Remote</ext-link>
by Jason Fried talks about this in great detail in the context of
software development, but the same principles apply to work in science.
What supervisors and administrators loose in direct oversight they can
in attracting talent they would otherwise not get. Remote work only
works if supported by the host institution, for example by adapting
internal workflows and communications to make remote work the default
rather than an exception.</p>
<p>Remote work is usually more successful and satisfying if combined
with physical presence at the workplace. Reasons for this are not only
the part of the work that can’t be done remotely, but more importantly
the social aspect. How extensive this physical presence is depends on
the circumstances. Some level of remote work has become part of almost
everyone’s job in science, as it includes working at home in the
evenings or on weekends, or work while traveling.</p>
