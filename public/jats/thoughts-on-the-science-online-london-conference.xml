<p>As one of the conference organizers I'm obviously biased as to how to
judge the success of the conference. But I think that organizing a
conference about the online communication of science is as much about
how to do things, as it is about finding the right session topics. And
as Science Online London is only in its second year (and the sister
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.scienceonline09.com/">ScienceOnline</ext-link>
in North Carolina in its third year), there are still a lot of things we
can do better.</p>
<sec id="what-i-liked">
  <title>What I liked</title>
  <p><italic><italic>No parallel sessions</italic></italic>
  Although we did have two slots with two parallel sessions each, all
  the other sessions were in the Faraday Theatre. I find that I always
  miss some great sessions in conferences with many parallel sessions.
  More importantly this format makes sure that everybody went to the
  same conference and discusses the same things. I like this because it
  builds a sense of community around the conference.</p>
  <p><italic><italic>No unconference sessions</italic></italic>
  Deciding on the session topics and speakers at the beginning of the
  conference is a concept that worked well for similar events in the
  past (e.g.
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/07/10/i-was-at-scibarcamp-palo-alto">SciBarCamp
  Palo Alto</ext-link>, and in part
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.nature.com/natureconferences/sciblog2008/index.html">Science
  Blogging London 2008</ext-link>). We decided to not use this format,
  which not only made the day of the conference much less stressful for
  the organizers, but also allowed us to have invite some interesting
  speakers that otherwise might not have come. This format also made it
  easier to have different topics and speakers from last year's
  conference (only 3 out of the 29 speakers also spoke last year).</p>
  <p><italic><italic>Live streaming of audio and video</italic></italic>
  We did stream audio and video of almost all sessions to
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/second-life.php">Second
  Life</ext-link>. Exceptions were the session on legal and ethical
  aspects of blogging (which we decided not to record because of the
  risk that some statements could be taken as legal advice), and the
  breakout sessions (where we could only record audio). One speaker
  (Dave Munger) even gave his presentation through Second Life.</p>
  <p>Because the Second Life users could give feedback through Second
  Life, Twitter or FriendFeed, this was really a virtual conference.
  Live video streaming (using Second Life or other technologies) should
  really become the norm for this kind of conference.</p>
  <p><italic><italic>A perfect location</italic></italic>
  The Royal Institution was really a perfect place for the conference.
  You could argue about the pink color of the seats, but the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&amp;id=00000001054">Faraday
  Theatre</ext-link> has just the right size and a great of history of
  communicating science.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="what-i-didn-t-like">
  <title>What I didn't like</title>
  <p><italic><italic>Not enough time in the sessions</italic></italic>
  We decided to go with 45 minute long sessions, and this turned out to
  be too short. I would have liked to have a 30 minute discussion in
  most sessions (some sessions worked well with shorter discussion time,
  e.g. <italic><italic>Legal and Ethical Aspects of Science
  Blogging</italic></italic>). Although there will always be session
  that require a different format, next time I would force speakers to
  limit their introduction to 15 minutes. And I would try to make the
  sessions 60 minutes long.</p>
  <p><italic><italic>Not enough time between sessions</italic></italic>
  The best part of a conference is often the discussions we have between
  sessions. For this we should have scheduled more time, e.g. by making
  the coffee breaks 45 minutes long and by having a conference dinner at
  the beginning of the conference. But the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002164342/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/blog/2009/07/20/announcing-social-events-for-thursday-friday/">social

  unconference on Friday were not only interesting events, but also
  great for networking. Doing a conference on a single day is just too
  short and I would make a repeat conference a two day event. With more
  time I would also really like to do a brief introduction of every
  participant (Ã  la

  <p><italic><italic>Do more moderation</italic></italic>
  Conferences have a tendency of always having the same people saying
  the same things. And discussions are sometimes more about people
  saying something that is dear to their heart rather than asking a
  question or trying to understand the other side. More moderation could
  help here to make the discussions more unexpected and productive.</p>
  <p><italic><italic>That iPhone that just didn't stop
  ringing</italic></italic>
  Unfortunately I just couldn't pay full attention to the last part of
  the discussion about real-time statistics. Despite
