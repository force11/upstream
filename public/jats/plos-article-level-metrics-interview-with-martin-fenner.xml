<p>This blog occasionally does interviews with people providing
interesting tools for scholars. These
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226124822/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/category/interviews/">interviews</ext-link>
have always been among my favorite blog posts. This now is obviously an
interview with myself, but I felt this is the best format to explain
some important news.</p>

<p>Starting May 16 I will be working full-time as technical lead for the

the

with since 2005. The ALM project was launched in 2009, and I first
learned about ALM in a July 2009 presentation by Pete Binfield at

  besides journal articles.</p>

  <title>Will you miss treating cancer patients and doing cancer

  <p>Absolutely. This has not been an easy decision. To make the
  transition easier, I will continue to spend 10% of my time at Hannover
  Medical School. I will no longer be seeing patients, but this will
  allow me to conclude the RADIT

  <p>I hope to continue doing research in the new position, but with a
  focus on information science. There are for example still a lot of
  things we don’t know about altmetrics. A more detailed analysis of our
