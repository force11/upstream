<p>Last Wednesday I attended the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://www.hcsmeucamp.com/">Health
Care Social Media Camp</ext-link> in Berlin. Healthcare Social Media in
Europe – <italic><italic>#hcsmeu</italic></italic> for short – is a
community of healthcare twitterers and social media users from Europe,
started in August 2009 by
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://www.whydotpharma.com/about/">Silja
Chouquet</ext-link> and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://stwem.com/">Andrew
Spong</ext-link>. I am interested in
<italic><italic>#hcsmeu</italic></italic> not only because I am a
physician treating cancer patients, but also because there is a lot of
overlap to many other things that interest me in doing and communicating
science online, e.g.

<p>The meeting was a small gathering of about 45 people in the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/07/10/i-was-at-scibarcamp-palo-alto">unconference</ext-link>
format, so we started with collecting questions we wanted to discuss
during the day. For each of the four sessions (patient perspective,
health care professional perspective, pharma perspective and
<italic><italic>#hcsmeu</italic></italic> mission and goals) we first
split up in 3-4 smaller groups to talk about some of the questions, and
in the second half summarized and discussed this as the whole group.
Some participants demonstrated excellent skills with the whiteboard.</p>
<p><italic><italic>How do we get scientists interested in social
media?</italic></italic> is something we have talked about many times,
e.g.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2009/10/19/scientists-still-not-joining-social-networks/">Scientists
Still Not Joining Social Networks</ext-link>. Healthcare professionals
are also reluctant to use social media, and we come up with some
interesting suggestions to do something about this:</p>

<p>We also talked about the dangers of getting involved with social
media. The doctor-patient communication is something that is difficult
to translate from personal communication to social media (lawyers and
some other professions have similar problems), but otherwise the dangers
look familiar to many scientists:</p>

<p>The last part of the meeting was about
<italic><italic>#hcsmeu</italic></italic>, and what next steps to take.
<italic><italic>#hcsmeu</italic></italic> is very focused on moving the
agenda forward, and that spirit penetrated the whole meeting. After a
very productive discussion we come up with some good action items:</p>

</fig>
<p><italic><italic>#hcsmeu</italic></italic> is very much built around
Twitter, including regular Tweetups every Friday, and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23hcsmeucamp">heavy
use</ext-link> during the meeting. I am a big
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://www.twitter.com/mfenner">Twitter
fan</ext-link>, but have
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/01/17/scienceonline2010-i-wish-i-was-there">argued
before</ext-link> that Twitter is not the best tool for conference
microblogging, as it is difficult to have connected discussions around a
topic, and archieving is complicated. And pictures, documents and links
are better collected in places like
<italic><italic>Flickr</italic></italic>,
<italic><italic>Slideshare</italic></italic> and
<italic><italic>delicious</italic></italic>.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095039/http://mfenner.posterous.com/best-practices-for-hcsmeu-social-media-use">My
suggestions</ext-link> for the <italic><italic>#hcsmeu</italic></italic>
knowledge hub therefore include more use of other social media tools,
plus <italic><italic>FriendFeed</italic></italic> or a similar
aggregation/microblogging tool to connect all the social media in one
place. <italic><italic>Facebook</italic></italic> is actually a perfect
tool to do all this, but unfortunately is still perceived by many as a
tool for <italic><italic>private</italic></italic> social networking. I
met many very smart and friendly people during the meeting and hope to
hear more about <italic><italic>#hcsmeu</italic></italic> at
<italic><italic>Science Online London 2010</italic></italic> in
September or the
