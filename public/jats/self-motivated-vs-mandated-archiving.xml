<p>My post last week about
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/10/18/new-in-plos-one-citation-rates-of-self-selected-vs-mandated-open-access/">citation
rates of mandated vs. self-selected Open Access</ext-link> resulted in
an interesting discussion thanks to some good arguments made by Stevan
Harnad. One personal conclusion for me: mandates for self-archiving are
not a good idea. I would very much prefer researchers to be highly
motivated to self-archive thanks to a repository that is both fulfilling
important functions and is fun to use.</p>

<p>What follows is a short list of ideas – many of them obvious and some
of them already implemented – that for me would make repositories more
attractive to use.</p>
<sec id="hosting-of-research-datasets">
  <title>Hosting of research datasets</title>
  <p>Disciplinary and institutional repositories are good places to make
  primary research data publicly available. Particularly if no standard
  database exists, such as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">GenBank</ext-link>
  for genetic sequence data. Whereas everybody nowadays talks about
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/~/link.aspx?_id=28A2778937C74EB285F05E38BFBD5DEE&amp;_z=z">making
  research data available</ext-link>, the threshold to do so is often
  too high for more specialized datasets. An institutional repository is
  a good place for simple grassroots solution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="a-disciplinary-repository-for-biomedical-research">
  <title>A disciplinary repository for biomedical research</title>
  <p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed
  Central</ext-link> and
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/">UK
  PubMed Central</ext-link> are very popular disciplinary repositories
  for the biomedical and life sciences. Unfortunately I can only submit
  manuscripts to them if the research was funded by one of a few funders
  (including the NIH, but none of the major German funders).</p>

<sec id="a-preprint-archive-for-clinical-trials">
  <title>A preprint archive for clinical trials</title>
  <p>Deposition of manuscripts prior to peer review
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/10/09/new-on-arxiv-first-report-of-soap-open-access-publishing-project/">has
  a long tradition</ext-link> in high-energy physics and related
  disciplines. Preprint archives probably don’t work in all disciplines,
  but I have

  before</ext-link> that they could be a very good idea for clinical
  trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="journal-publishers-that-allow-self-archiving">
  <title>Journal publishers that allow self-archiving</title>
  <p>While most publishers allow some form of self-archiving by authors
  (pre-print, post-print and/or publisher’s PDF version), there are
  unfortunately still exceptions. The American Chemical Society (ACS)
  has a
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://scientopia.org/blogs/bookoftrogool/2010/10/05/acs-the-perfect-storm/">particularly
  unwelcoming policy</ext-link>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="integration-with-the-journal-submission-process">
  <title>Integration with the journal submission process</title>
  <p>An institutional repository can host pre-prints of submitted
  papers. But the repository could also enable a tighter integration
  with the journal submission process. The German
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/https://www.escidoc.org/JSPWiki/en/Overview">eSciDoc</ext-link>
  project uses that approach. Most researchers would probably welcome
  technical and financial assistance in the submission process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="integration-with-institutional-bibliography">
  <title>Integration with institutional bibliography</title>
  <p>The institutional bibliography showcases the scholarly work done by
  a particular researcher, research group, department or institution.
  Many researchers like to see up-to-date profiles (including
  publication lists) on their institutional webpages. Bibliographies are
  also collected for evaluation purposes. We have started to use
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.bibapp.org/">BibApp</ext-link>
  at our institution. Repositories can facilitate fulltext access to PhD
  theses and other publications in the bibliography.</p>

<sec id="repositories-that-use-unique-author-identifiers">
  <title>Repositories that use unique author identifiers</title>
  <p>Regular readers of this blog know about
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/07/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy/">my
  involvement</ext-link> in the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID
  (ORCID) initiative. All scholarly contributions, including repository
  content, should be unambiguously connected to their creators as this
  will greatly facilitate the discovery process. I look forward to ORCID
  support in repository software such as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191039/http://www.dspace.org/">DSpace</ext-link>
