Online London 2011 Conference</ext-link> takes place September 2-3 at
the British Library. I am again one of the organizers (together with
<italic><italic>Lou Woodley</italic></italic> from Nature.com and
<italic><italic>Kaitlin Thaney</italic></italic> from Digital Science),
and I’m getting both excited and nervous the closer we get to
September.</p>

<p>We have recently posted a first draft of the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.html">conference
program</ext-link>, and you can see that we are trying something new. In
addition to the keynotes, panel discussions and breakout sessions we had
the last few years we have also scheduled four workshops for the second
day of the conference. I’m doing a workshop called <bold><bold>Beyond
scholarly publication</bold></bold> together with <italic><italic>Eva
Amsen</italic></italic> (The Node) and <italic><italic>Mark
Hahnel</italic></italic> (FigShare). The idea is to really have a
hands-on experience, and in this workshop we will focus on blogs and
related tools. We will try to do something interesting both for someone
who wants to start a science blog, but also for more experienced writers
(e.g.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://scholarlyhtml.org/">Scholarly
HTML</ext-link> or
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">ePub</ext-link>).
We haven’t work out the details, so please drop us a note if there is a
particular topic that you want to see covered. All workshops will focus
on <bold><bold>Spinal Muscular Atrophy</bold></bold> as a theme, and we
hope that everybody has learned a few tricks by the end of the day.</p>
<p>We are still looking for breakout session suggestions for the first
day of the conference. If you have a good idea, please add it to the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611105557/http://scienceonlinelondon.wikidot.com/">wiki</ext-link>,
as we hope to have a program that is (close to) final by July.</p>
