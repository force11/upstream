<p>Last weekend was <italic><italic>BibCamp Hannover</italic></italic>,
a “BarCamp for librarians and other hackers”. If you understand German,
you can read about the sessions, discusions and people in the

and

<p>The BarCamp format worked very well for us – we used traditional pen
and paper for session planning:</p>

<p>I had suggested a session about
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033833/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/05/03/bibapp-mashups-for-universities">Institutional
Bibliographies</ext-link>. We combined this with two related suggestions
and had a very interesting session about the communication of scientists
with librarians. One interesting theme in the discussion was the notion
that the scientific workflow seems to be broken at some specific steps,
for example:</p>
<sec id="deposition-of-post-prints-in-institutional-repositories">
  <title>Deposition of post-prints in institutional repositories</title>
  <p>Most journals allow authors to make the final version of an
  accepted manuscript (i.e. after peer review)
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033833/http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeoinfo.html#prepostprints">publicly
  available</ext-link> via an institutional repository. Most librarians
  would be happy to help their authors with this step, but unfortunately
  have no good tools to track the papers published at their institution,
  and never see the final version of accepted manuscript (many journals
  don't allow publisher-generated PDFs in repositories).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="re-submission-of-rejected-manuscripts">
  <title>Re-submission of rejected manuscripts</title>
  <p>Rejected manuscripts are usually resubmitted to a different journal
  (most manuscripts will eventually be published
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033833/http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ede.0000254668.63378.32">somewhere</ext-link>).
  Unfortunately the next journal will most likely use a different
  manuscript format, different citation styles and a different
  manuscript submission system. Some journals provide a
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033833/http://www.nature.com/authors/author_services/transfer_manuscripts.html">manuscript
  transfer service</ext-link>, but the comments made in the peer review
  are usually not available to the editors and reviewers of the next
  journal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="connecting-scientists-to-publications">
  <title>Connecting scientists to publications</title>
  <p>This is a topic that I have written about before
  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033833/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/01/03/orcid-or-how-to-build-a-unique-identifier-for-scientists-in-10-easy-steps">ORCID
  or how to build a unique identifier for scientists in 10 easy
  steps</ext-link>). Until we have unique author identifiers, it is
  difficult or impossible to reliably find the papers published by a
  particular person (a good number of papers by <italic><italic>Fenner
  M</italic></italic> in <italic><italic>PubMed</italic></italic> are
  not written by me).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="distributing-papers-for-a-journal-club">
  <title>Distributing papers for a journal club</title>
  <p>Another topic I have written about before
  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611033833/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/08/08/recipe-distributing-papers-for-a-journal-club">Recipe:
  Distributing papers for a journal club</ext-link>). The problem is not
  only that email is really bad for sending PDF files to a group of
  people, but that most journals don't allow redistribution of their
  content, even within an institution with an institutional
  subscription.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="citation-counts">
  <title>Citation counts</title>
  <p>The number of times a paper is cited is often used as a proxy to
  the importance of the science in that paper. Citation counts (e.g. in
  the form of Impact Factor or H-Index) are often used to evaluate
  researchers. There are many problems with this approach, because
  citation counts are influenced by many other factors (e.g. time,
  popularity of the subject area, self-citations). But the biggest
  problem is the fact that there is no general agreement on how to count
  citations, and no database that makes this information freely
  available.</p>
  <p>It might make sense to make a list of these broken steps, and then
  estimate the effort that would be required to fix each of them. Some
  broken steps are more important, and some fixes easier than others, so
  this exercise would give a good list of action points.</p>
