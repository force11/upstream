post</ext-link>, PLoS community manager Brian Mossop talks about how
PLoS Blogs came to life, and the lessons learned from other blogging
networks. For me personally it all started a few weeks ago with a phone
call one Friday evening from
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.plos.org/about/people/one.php#pbinfield">Pete
Binfield</ext-link>, Publisher of PLoS ONE and the PLoS Community
Journals.</p>
<p>Since August 2007 and until today I was blogging over at
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner">Nature
Network</ext-link>. The focus of that blog was how the internet is
changing scientific publishing. This is obviously a very broad topic. A
lot of my blog posts looked at rather technical aspects, including new
products and services (the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/08/29/elsevier-launches-sciverse-integrates-sciencedirect-scopus-more">last
post</ext-link> was about Elsevier’s SciVerse that launched last
weekend).</p>
<p>I will continue to write about the same topics. I particularly like
to continue
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/08/31/bye-bye-nature-network">interviews</ext-link>,
and I want to write more recipes
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/08/08/recipe-distributing-papers-for-a-journal-club">Recipe:
Distributing papers for a journal club</ext-link>). Of course I also
want to try different things, e.g. shorter blog posts of interesting
stuff I find (something I currently post on Twitter). Please contact me
if you have something related to scientific publishing that you want me
to write about.</p>
<p>PLoS Blogs is not the only new science blogging network.

Science Blogs</ext-link> launched just yesterday, and

an aggregator of science blogs (to keep track of all those great blog
posts), was launched by Anton Zuiker, Bora Zivkovic and Dave Munger two
weeks ago.</p>
<p>This is a good week for science blogging for another reason. The

Online London Conference</ext-link> takes place this Friday and
Saturday. Most relevant to the launch of PLoS Blogs is the panel
discussion Friday afternoon

<p>There will of course be other exciting sessions. The panel
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#panel1">“Rebooting”
(aka the future of) science journalism</ext-link> with David Dobbs, Ed
Yong, Martin Robbins and Alice Bell should be a lot of fun. The closing
panel discussion on Saturday
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#panel3">If

lack thereof) of  Web 2.0 tools for scholarly communication, based on a

report</ext-link> by the Research Information Network. And a number of
sessions focus on open data, a trending topic I’m personally very
interested in. Together with Geoff Bilder and Gudmundur Thorisson I will
moderate a session
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093643/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.php?tab=abstracts#breakout11">ORCID

be happy?</ext-link></p>
<p>Most importantly, Science Online London is a great opportunity to
meet many of my fellow science bloggers in person, and this includes
Brian Mossop, the PLoS Blogs community manager. Expect more reports from
Science Online London in the next few days, for more up to date
