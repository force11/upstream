18 issue</ext-link> <italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic> started to
support XMP markup in article PDFs (reported last week on the
<italic><italic>Nascent</italic></italic> blog by <italic><italic>Tony
Hammond</italic></italic>)<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/12/22/just_doi_it/#fn1">1</ext-link></sup>.
XMP stands for Extensible Metadata Platform and is a technology to embed
metadata in files, including
PDFs<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/12/22/just_doi_it/#fn2">2</ext-link></sup>.
XMP was created by Adobe (with XMP support in PDF files since 2001), but
is an open standard with backing by others, including Creative
Commons<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/12/22/just_doi_it/#fn3">3</ext-link></sup>.
The Digital Object Identifier
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</ext-link>)
is the most important piece of information in the metadata, as the DOI
provides a link to the journal publisher website where more metadata can
be retrieved. XMP support in scientific PDFs is unfortunately still very
uncommon and probably hasn't changed much since
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://network.nature.com/people/lindenb/profile">Pierre
Lindenbaum</ext-link> checked last
year<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/12/22/just_doi_it/#fn4">4</ext-link></sup>.</p>
<p>Adding metadata to PDFs seems to be a no-brainer. We have done the
same with music (mp3 ID) and photos (IPTC and EXIF) for years and it has
been a tremendous help in organizing these files stored on our
computers. Unfortunately there aren't too many tools that can extract
the DOI or other metadata from the XMP in article PDFs. But I expect
more desktop software to support XMP, once XMP support in scientific
articles is more widespread. We will then be able to add a journal PDF
to our reference manager of choice and have the relevant metadata
(including authors, title, journal and issue) automatically filled in.
As well as many other creative uses. Until then we need tools like
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</ext-link>
or
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003053153/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</ext-link>
that can extract metadata from PDF files without this XMP
information.</p>
