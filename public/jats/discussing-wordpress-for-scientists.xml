<p>Regular readers of this blog know about
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/tag/wordpress/">my
current interest in WordPress</ext-link> as a tool to create scholarly
content. In the last few weeks I have released several WordPress plugins
for
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bibtex-importer/">reference

ePub</ext-link> files. Obviously I’m not the only person having this
idea. Some interesting projects are:</p>

<p>WordPress is by far the most popular blogging platform, and many
science bloggers (including us here at PLoS Blogs) use WordPress. And
science bloggers have some specific requirements, e.g. easy to use tools
for linking to scholarly papers or aggregators of blog posts about a
particular paper
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.researchblogging.org/">ResearchBlogging</ext-link>)
or science blogging in general
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://scienceblogging.org/2011/01/15/introducing-scienceseeker/">ScienceSeeker</ext-link>).
A number of people use WordPress as a lab notebook (e.g.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.carlboettiger.info/">Carl
Boettinger</ext-link>). There is no clear difference between WordPress
as a scholarly writing tool and WordPress as a blogging tool, and I
expect that the amount of scholarly writing done with WordPress will
only increase.</p>

<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/02/02/research-into-reprogrammed-stem-cells-an-interactive-timeline/">published
an interactive timeline</ext-link> of research into reprogrammed stem
cells. John Rennie yesterday cited Ed Yong and this post as a wonderful
example of the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://blogs.plos.org/retort/2011/02/03/why-ed-yong-is-the-future-of-science-news-and-you-could-be-too/">future
of science news</ext-link>. The future of science news depends on many
things (not least brilliant writers such as Ed and John), but I think we
also need better tools to make science writing fun and exciting.</p>
<p>In the hope that this will improve WordPress as a science writing
platform, Mark Hahnel from the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134839/http://www.science3point0.com/">Science

for Scientists</ext-link> Google Group. We invite developers who are
working on scholarly plugins and themes for WordPress to join this
group, but also researchers that need specific WordPress tools (e.g. to
hook up their lab equiment to WordPress), and science bloggers that have
cool ideas on how to improve WordPress for their needs.</p>
