<p>PDF has become the standard way we consume scientific papers, but in
fact is not a good format for this purpose at all. Or as

<p>There are of course ways journal publishers can add metadata to PDF
files, e.g. using
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/12/22/just_doi_it/">XMP</ext-link>
markup. But that is only a workaround – what we really want is journal
papers in a format that is all about document structure and not about
looking good in print. XML is obviously that format with the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.inera.com/nlmresources.shtml">NLM-DTD</ext-link>
as the de facto standard for scholarly publications. Many journal
publishers use that format internally, as does
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed
Central</ext-link> for displaying fulltext papers, as well as archiving
projects such as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.portico.org/digital-preservation/">Portico</ext-link>.</p>
<p>But there are two problems with how NLM-DTD is used now. The first
problem is that most scientific papers still are ultimately read as
printouts of PDF files, even though most journals now are online only. I
wrote in January that this reading behavior is starting to change
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/01/10/how_do_you_read_papers_2010_will_be_different/">How
do you read papers? 2010 will be different</ext-link>), and new article
formats – such as the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/07/26/how_does_the_article_of_the_future_look_like/">Article
of the Future</ext-link> by Cell Press – and the success of the iPad are
two major reasons for that.</p>
<p>The second problem is that there are no good NLM-DTD tools for
authors.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/02/27/lemon8_xml_interview_with_mj_suhonos/">Lemon8-XML</ext-link>
and the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/07/interview_with_pablo_fernicola/">Microsoft
Word Article Authoring Add-In</ext-link> are two examples that I have
written about before. Publishers spend a significant amount of time and
money (and using tools such as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/05/01/extyles_interview_with_elizabeth_blake_and_bruce_rosenblum/">eXtyles</ext-link>)
to convert submitted manuscripts from Microsoft Word, Open Office or
LaTeX formats into NLM-DTD. I wrote about my
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/06/14/my_paper_writing_dream_machine_1_0/">paper
writing dream machine</ext-link> that would use the NLM-DTD more than
two years ago. I still believe that the ideal authoring tool should be
web-based, but in 2010 this should be done in HTML5 and not Adobe Flash
or Microsoft Silverlight.</p>
<p>The two problems are obviously related. When more people are reading
papers in other formats than PDF and see the advantages, it changes the
idea of a scientific paper that most people have from a static document
do a document that is enriched with primary research data,
visualizations that use 3D and video, links to related resources, the
possibility to comment, and has more than one document version. In other
words, what HTML and the WWW
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">were
invented for</ext-link> by Tim Berners-Lee when working at CERN. At this
point the incentives to create better authoring tools will be much
greater, and the second problem should solve itself. And HTML and
related technologies have now evolved to the point where they allow the
building of some very attractive authoring tools.</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.sdsc.edu/~bourne/">Phil

including a recent editorial in <italic><italic>PLoS Computational
Biology</italic></italic>

<bold><bold>Beyond the PDF</bold></bold> workshop, to be held in San
Diego January 19-21. The workshop

went live last week and is a very good source of information. The goal
of the workshop is to identify a set of requirements and to start
developing open source code that accelerates moving beyond PDF for
scientific papers.</p>
<p>I will of course do everything possible to attend this workshop, but
haven’t yet secured funding for the trip. What I hope to contribute to
the <bold><bold>Beyond the PDF</bold></bold> project is a more
intelligent use of citations (the following was also posted to the

<sec id="unique-author-identifiers">
  <title>Unique Author Identifiers</title>
  <p>Unique author identifiers such as

  not only are a big help in knowledge discovery (finding other
  interesting papers, datasets, etc. by the same person), but they can
  also help to better define the contributions of a researcher to a
  particular paper. This could mean a general description of the
  contribution (had idea for project, collected data, helped write
  manuscript, etc.), or could also describe a very specific contribution
  (researcher X did experiment Y).</p>

<sec id="citation-styles">
  <title>Citation styles</title>
  <p>We already have far too many citation styles, but the styles we use
  have several important shortcomings. I suggest the following
  changes:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p>Use the
      <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</ext-link>
      instead of volume and page numbers whenever possible</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Use <bold><bold>ORCID</bold></bold> to link to the authors of
      the citations</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Use the Citation Typing Ontology
      (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://www.crossref.org/CrossTech/2009/03/citation_typing_ontology.html">CiTO</ext-link>)
      to describe the meaning of the citation</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Use a note field to explain why the citation was used</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>Any authoring tool should obviously use the Citation Style Language
  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/24/citation-style-language-an-interview-with-rintze-zelle-and-ian-mulvany/">CSL</ext-link>)
  to format citations. And the citations should be provided with a
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185433/http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC
  Zero</ext-link> or similar license to allow reuse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="cited-by">
  <title>Cited by</title>
  <p>At least as important as the citations by a particular paper are
  the incoming citations, the works that cite a paper. We need much
  better mechanisms to automate these “trackbacks”, and this should go
  beyond other papers and also include datasets, blog posts, etc. The
  incoming citations are of course very helpful for discovery, and the
  basis for
