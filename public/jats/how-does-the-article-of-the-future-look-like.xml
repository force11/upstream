the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://beta.cell.com/">Article
of the Future</ext-link> project, again a project on how scientific
articles should be presented online. It is not clear of how the material
submitted in the Article 2.0 contest was used to create the Article of
the Future prototypes. Some key features of the prototypes are:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>Tabbed browsing of article sections</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>hierarchical presentation of text and figures</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>graphical abstract and research highlights</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>integrated audio and video</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>real-time reference analyses</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>Two sample articles are provided by Cell Press
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://beta.cell.com/erickson/">here</ext-link>
and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://beta.cell.com/hochstim/">here</ext-link>).
They are a good starting point to discuss what works and what doesn't.
And I don't want to get into the discussion of whether naming this
project <italic><italic>Article of the Future</italic></italic> is a
little bit overambitious for the small changes that were proposed in the
prototypes. Here are my thoughts on some of the features that might be
useful in displaying research articles online (a lot of them have
already been implemented by one journal or another):</p>
<sec id="navigation">
  <title>Navigation</title>
  <p>Navigation to a specific section (e.g. discussion) is an obvious
  feature that many journals have implemented. This navigation should
  also work as links from the outside, and should also allow direct
  linking to a figure or table.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="abstract">
  <title>Abstract</title>
  <p>The traditional abstract can be extended for the online version of
  a manuscript. This could be an easier to read summary of the article
  or an audio or video abstract. Abstracts are important teasers to read
  the fulltext paper, and the current format might not be appropriate
  for everyone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="integration-of-figures-and-tables">
  <title>Integration of figures and tables</title>
  <p>Most journals don't fully integrate figures and tables in their
  online papers, but rather put them on a separate page and link to
  them. This is similar to the PDF version of a paper, where figures
  often have to be placed away from the text section discussing them.
  The online version of a paper should allow viewing the figures and
  tables in parallel to reading the next, preferably by using a two
  column layout. Supplementary information should be integrated in a
  similar manner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="references">
  <title>References</title>
  <p>Going back and forth between the citation in the text and the
  reference at the end of the article is one of the annoyances of the
  traditional paper format. Online papers should make this easier, e.g.
  by displaying the full reference when hovering over the citation. A
  separate column for the references could also work, but three columns
  (text, figures, and references) might confuse the typical reader. The
  reference section should include links to the referenced paper,
  preferably using the DOI. Additional information about these
  references (e.g. links to PubMed, links to the full text, number of
  citations) could also be provided. A “return to text” is a nice touch
  at <italic><italic>Biomed Central</italic></italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="related-content">
  <title>Related content</title>
  <p>Other papers citing the article should be listed and linked to.
  Showing related articles would be helpful, but I have yet to see a
  working implementation of that feature (maybe with the help of
  services such as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://www.citulike.org/">CiteULike</ext-link>
  or
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</ext-link>?).
  A good starting point would be to include other articles by the same
  authors and articles that are cited by the paper. Links to blog posts
  and other online content (e.g. on
  <italic><italic>Twitter</italic></italic> or
  <italic><italic>FriendFeed</italic></italic>) talking about the
  article would be very helpful, but that is difficult to do. Linking to
  the places that bookmark the article (e.g. on
  <italic><italic>CiteULike</italic></italic>,
  <italic><italic>Connotea</italic></italic>,
  <italic><italic>2collab</italic></italic>) is a good starting point to
  find other users with related interests. Therefore it is also helpful
  to make it easy to share the article using these services (as they all
  use bookmarklets for that, this is more about providing good import
  filters).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="article-publication-history">
  <title>Article Publication History</title>
  <p>The publication history of the article (submission and acceptance
  dates, as well as reviewer comments, etc.) provides interesting
  addition information about a paper, and is for example provided by
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/9/127/prepub">BioMed
  Central journals</ext-link>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="comments-and-usage-statistics">
  <title>Comments and usage statistics</title>
  <p>Comments should be possible not only at the end of the article, but
  also within specific sections (such as
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://www.plosone.org/static/commentGuidelines.action">notes</ext-link>
  in PLoS journals). And comments should be implemented using an API,
  allowing viewing and adding comments from within other services. Usage
  statistics are another way to look at the popularity of a paper, and
  should soon be available for the
  <italic><italic>PLoS</italic></italic> journals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="semantic-markup">
  <title>Semantic markup</title>
  <p>This is an area where I would expect the biggest changes to the
  current format – papers currently have little or no support for this
  and that is a shame.
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002145328/http://imageweb.zoo.ox.ac.uk/pub/2008/plospaper/latest/">Here</ext-link>
  is an example of a semantically enhanced PLoS Neglected Tropical
  Diseases article. Another example is semantic markup used by
  <italic><italic>Nature Chemistry</italic></italic>, as discussed in
