years old today</ext-link>, and it has been a very interesting ride. I
wasn't around when Nature Network started, but posted by first
Gobbledygook blog post (the blog had a different name back then) in
August 2007. We passed the

learned a lot about science publishing and met a large number of very
nice and very clever people both online and offline. I wrote about 160

regular basis (I decided a while ago to aim for one blog post per week).
I am also excited about the upcoming
