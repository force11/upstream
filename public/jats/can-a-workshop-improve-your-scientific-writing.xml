<p>How could you improve your scientific writing skills? Two months ago

about books. Another idea would be a scientific writing workshop. This
weekend I attended such a workshop, organized by Julia Klapproth and
Barry Drees from

Writing &amp; Consulting</ext-link>.</p>
<p>The workshop was organized as a 1 1/2 day course with many group
exercises. We learned about good scientifc language, tables and graphs
and other typical aspects of manuscript writing. Stuff you will also
find in books such as

â€“ and more fun.</p>
<p>To my surprise the most important lesson was something else. Good
scientific writing always has a message, targeted towards the audience.
This is probably obvious for anybody with basic experience in
journalism. But it is easier said than done when the results of your
experiments are complicated and not easily fit into a model. I will try
much harder to keep this in mind, e.g. by making sure that the abstract
and tables/figures can speak for themselves.</p>
