<p>The German medical journal <italic><italic>Deutsches</italic>
Ä<italic>rzteblatt</italic></italic> did an analysis of the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085236/http://www.aerzteblatt.de/int/article.asp?id=60949">percentage
of female first authors over the last 50 years</ext-link>. The number
was 0-4% as recently as 25 years ago, but there has been a yearly
increase to 18% last year (see this
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085236/http://www.aerzteblatt.de/int/bild.asp?id=24380">figure</ext-link>),
both for submitted and accepted manuscripts. This number corresponds to
the percentage of female senior faculty in Germany, but 64% of students
starting to study medicine last year were women. A similar increase –
although to higher numbers – has been seen in biology (see
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085236/http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.10160">this
study</ext-link>).</p>
<p>These numbers seem to indicate that women are neither less likely nor
more likely to have a manuscript accepted. Unless you assume that women
are more often denied first authorship than men. But I was surprised to
learn how little progress had been made between 1957 and 1982.

study</ext-link> of female first and senior authorship in American
medical journals probably gives the explanation. The numbers of female
medical students didn't start to rise until the 1970s, and they probably
started to write their first papers about ten years later. Which would
mean that in another 25 years female first and senior authors in medical
journals should be as common as their male colleagues. Isn't that a bit
long in the future?</p>
