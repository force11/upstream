<p>Erythropoietin is an effective drug to increase your number of red
blood cells. It is primarily used in anemic patients with

and on

but it is also popular with athletes that want to (illegally) increase
their endurance performance, most notably cyclists and cross country
skiers.</p>
<p>Although the typical work of a scientist is a very different from a
cyclist performing in the Tour de France, a first case of erythropoietin
use(or rather misuse) has now been reported in Germany. A neurobiology
postdoc working on the role of erythropoietin in

disease</ext-link> has apparently had the idea to do a little
self-experimenting – probably thinking of the famous experiment by Barry
Marshall that
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111109/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2005/marshall-lecture.pdf">won
him</ext-link> a Nobel Price. Or he was pictured – during his long
experiments lasting well into the night – the famous German cross
country skier Johann Mühlegg who

to win</ext-link> an Olympic Gold medal in Salt Lake City with the help
of darbepoetin. What he didn't think of was the price of erythropoietin.
After burning some 20.000 Euro, the technician and then the principal
investigator became suspicious. The case is now under investigation by
the university and the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611111109/http://www.dfg.de/">Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft</ext-link>. What the authorities don't know is
how to handle this case. Is this simply misappropriation of the research
funds, is this brain doping, or is this a misunderstood brilliant
scientist? The

Anti-Brain Doping Authority</ext-link> now got involved to help clear
the issues.</p>
