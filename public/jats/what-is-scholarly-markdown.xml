<p>One of the important discussions taking place at the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki">Markdown
for Science</ext-link> workshop last weekend was about the definition of
Scholarly Markdown. We came up with
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/What-is-Markdown">this</ext-link>:</p>
<list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
    <p>Markdown that supports the requirements of scientific texts</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Markdown as format that glues open scientific text resources
    together</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>A reference implementation with documentation and tests</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>A community</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>We also agreed that <bold><bold>Scholarly Markdown</bold></bold> is a
better term than <bold><bold>Markdown for Science</bold></bold>, as it
also includes the Social Sciences and Humanities. And we agreed on a
hashtag,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23scholmd&amp;src=typd">#scholmd</ext-link>.</p>
<p>I like #3 and #4, and I was not surprised to see #1. #2 is one of the
most important outcomes of the workshop for me personally, and was
reflected in the discussion we had in the breakout session on
<italic>What is needed for Markdown to be adopted by the scientific
community?</italic> One important strategy is the following:</p>
<p specific-use="wrapper">
  <disp-quote>
    <p>We need an online tool that makes it easy for scholars to write
    scholarly markdown in a collaborative manner.</p>
  </disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We called this the <bold><bold>Google Docs for
Scientists</bold></bold> (Google Docs is a good collaborative tool, but
is lacking some important features required for scientific documents,
e.g. integrated citation management).
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.authorea.com/">Authorea</ext-link>
was mentioned as a promising example of this concept. It was also noted
that some previous efforts failed, because the tool looked too different
from Microsoft Word. But building such a tool wouldnâ€™t really require
markdown as a file format, and could for example also be done directly
in HTML5. This would be a reasonable strategy, but in my mind is falling
short because I think the problem we need to solve is more complicated
than making collaboration easier with tools that look like Microsoft
Word. We therefore also discussed a different strategy:</p>
<p specific-use="wrapper">
  <disp-quote>
    <p>We need multiple tools that make it easy for scholars to create
    scholarly markdown documents and openly share them. This
    collaborative work is not limited to authoring scholarly papers, but
    also includes shorter scholarly texts, e.g. experimental results,
    lab notebooks, lecture notes, blog posts and working papers. Ease of
    use is not only defined by the writing experience, but also how easy
    it is to share documents with others.</p>
  </disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This definition almost sounds like a definition for Open Science, and
assumes that data - and increasingly software - are an integral part of
reporting science. This makes
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/reproducibility">reproducibility</ext-link>
of scientific results much easier, and one nice example how this can be
done is the integration of markdown into the R statistical software,
using the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr
package</ext-link>. Using the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/plos-alm-data/">May
2013 PLOS article-level metrics data</ext-link> which are freely
available for download, the R code below can be embedded into a markdown
file and will produce the bar plot below when the markdown file is run
in R (to try this yourself, download the ALM data and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/articlemetrics/plosOpenR/blob/master/barPlotSummary.Rmd">markdown
file for this article</ext-link>).</p>

<p>In a way this approach to scholarly markdown is much more difficult
than building a nice online collaborative writing tool. But for me
scholarly markdown is not about competing with Microsoft Word, it is
about building something new that scholars want to use because it allows
them to do something that is impossible with the existing tools. For the
same reason my todo item at the end of the workshop was <italic>think
about document type where markdown shines</italic>. The R example above
is a great example where markdown shines. If you can think of additional
examples, please add them to the comments.</p>
