<p>Participation in a social network can have it's perks. Thanks to the
O'Reilly Group on
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090051/http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</ext-link>
(that other social network), I received a review copy of
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090051/http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596515164/index.html">Wikipedia:
The Missing Manual</ext-link>. But why would a scientist want to know
how to write and edit articles on Wikipedia?</p>
<p>Wikipedia has become a respectable source of information that rivals
the more traditional encylopedias such as the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
Remember the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090051/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7070/full/438900a.html">December
2005 Nature study</ext-link> that compared the two? Wikipedia has
accurate information even on such obscure topics as dwarf
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090051/http://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Mammuthus_primigenius">woolly
mammoths</ext-link> from Wrangel Island.</p>
<p>But we all know that Wikipedia is
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090051/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7111/full/443493a.html">not
perfect</ext-link>. If we want to improve the information on topics we
care about – and probably have spent years working on – we could become
a Wikipedia editor. Especially if we are interested in an audience that
includes not only fellow scientists, but also people from other
scientific disciplines, journalists or students.</p>
<p>Writing and editing content on Wikipedia is a complicated process.
Because anyone can edit content, a great number of rules exist to make
sure that the articles have correct information, don't violate privacy,
aren't misused as marketing opportunity, etc. All these rules, as well
as many practical tips and other tools are of course available
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612090051/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents">online</ext-link>.
But <italic><italic>Wikipedia: The Missing Manual</italic></italic> is a
very good text for the aspiring new Wikipedia editor that wants a more
systematic introduction.</p>
