<p>Like many other blogging platforms, Nature Network uses
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040405/http://textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</ext-link>
to format blog entries. Textile is a markup language, and Andrew Sun has
nicely put together the most important tags in
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040405/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/andrewsun/2007/09/09/textism-a-better-guide-to-formatting-in-nature-network">this
blog post</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Textile doesn't much help with formatting that is
specific to science blogging. Specifically, there is no standard way to
link to journal articles. Should we use the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040405/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</ext-link>,
should we link to
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040405/http://www.pubmed.gov/">Pubmed</ext-link>,
or should we link to the journal homepage? If we do the latter, should
we link to the fulltext (that might not be accessible to everybody) or
the abstract? And why is there no standard markup for this?</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040405/http://www.mediawiki.org/">MediaWiki</ext-link>,
the platform behind
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040405/http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</ext-link>,
uses a different markup language. Here,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040405/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PMID">linking
to PubMed</ext-link> is semiautomated.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040405/http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorlage:DOI">Linking
to DOIs</ext-link> is also supported. And the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040405/http://openwetware.org/wiki/Biblio">Biblio</ext-link>
extension, also used by
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611040405/http://openwetware.org/">OpenWetWare</ext-link>,
makes linking to papers even easier.</p>
<p>We have often talked about standard data formats. And the small
things also matter. One result of standard blog linking to papers: it
would become much easier to find all blog posts that link to a
particular paper.</p>
