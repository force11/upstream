<p>Yesterday PLOS Biology published an essay by me:
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687">What
Can Article Level Metrics Do for You?</ext-link> (Fenner, 2013). I had
help from many others in writing the essay, in particular PLOS Biology
editor Emma Ganley. I hope that the essay can help researchers get
introduced to article-level metrics, and I am honored that the essay is
part of the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001688">PLOS
Biology 10th anniversary collection</ext-link>.</p>
<p>The essay is an Open Access article published under a CC-BY license,
so not only can everyone read it, but the text and figures can be freely
reused, as long as proper attribution is provided, e.g. Fig. 5:</p>
<fig>
  <caption><p><bold>PLOS Biology articles: sites of recommendation and
  discussion</bold>. Number of PLOS Biology research articles published
  until May 20, 2013 that have been recommended by F1000Prime (red)
  and/or mentioned in Wikipedia (blue). Taken from
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687.g005">doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687.g005</ext-link></p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Although this is an essay and not a research article, Iâ€™ve added the
data and R scripts used to generate the figures (1, 3-5) as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001687.s001">supporting
information</ext-link>. As I
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/10/20/the-complete-article/">have
said earlier</ext-link>, I think it is important that an article
contains more than the text. With the open source software
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</ext-link>
or
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</ext-link>
everyone can recreate the figures, and can look at the data underlying
the figures in the essay. One can for example look into the data behind
Fig. 5 to better understand how articles with F1000Prime recommendations
<bold><bold>and</bold></bold> Wikipedia mentions differ from those
<bold><bold>only</bold></bold> recommended in F1000Prime. Feel free to
ask for help getting started in the comments.</p>
<p>Incidentally this is also my first PLOS article (my wife is way ahead
of me with 5 research articles), so that I can finally look at PLOS
article-level metrics as an author - after being the technical lead for
this project since May 2012.</p>
