<p>Three days ago I blogged about Yale University
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114852/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/08/05/yale-university-drops-biomed-central-membership">dropping</ext-link>
their Biomed Central (BMC) membership. Matthew Cockerill, the BMC
publisher yesterday
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610114852/http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/yale_and_open_access_publishing">wrote
a response</ext-link>. Briefly, he argues that the author-pays model is
a viable business model for Open Access publishing and that the rising
costs cited by Yale are simply a reflection of the increasing number of
articles submitted to BMC.</p>
<p>This is an important discussion. I believe that the costs (especially
work hours) associated with publishing an article can still be reduced
by intelligent use of Web 2.0 technologies (see also my blog post on

formats</ext-link>). I also believe that the appropriate business model
very much depends on the journal type.</p>
