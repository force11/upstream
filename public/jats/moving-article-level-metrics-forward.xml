<p>In September <italic><italic>PLoS</italic></italic> started to show
usage data (downloads, citations, but also use of social bookmarking
services and blog posts) for all their published papers

<italic><italic>PLoS</italic></italic> is not the first publisher to do
that, but certainly the largest to date. Two Nature Network bloggers
wrote about these changes back in June (The Scientist:

<p>There are a number of reasons why article-level metrics are a good
idea, and I hope that many other journal publishers will follow. But in
this blog post I want to talk about some of the shortcomings of the
current implementation of article-level metrics.</p>
<sec id="article-level-metrics-should-be-combined-from-different-places">
  <title>Article-level metrics should be combined from different
  places</title>
  <p>Full-text articles live in more than one place. Obviously at the
  journal publisher's website, but in many cases also in one or more
  institutional repositories and at
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed
  Central</ext-link> (or similar places for papers not published in the
  life sciences). Which of these places produces the most reliable
  article-level metrics or should the HTML views, PDF downloads, etc.
  from all these places be combined? The decentralized nature of
  institutional repositories makes it especially difficult to combine
  usage statistics from them, but there are
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://www.dini.de/projekte/oa-statistik/english/">projects</ext-link>
  that try to tackle this problem. A unique identifier is required to
  combine the usage data from these different sources, and we have the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://www.doi.org/">DOI</ext-link>
  for that. <italic><italic>PubMed Central</italic></italic> and similar
  large repositories could not only start to provide their own usage
  data, but also combine them with the usage data from those journal
  publishers that already provide them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="article-level-metrics-need-author-identifiers">
  <title><italic><italic>Article-level metrics need author
  identifiers</italic></italic></title>
  <p>Evaluating the “impact” of a researcher is one obvious use for
  article-level metrics. In order to be able to do that for more than a
  handful of researchers, we need unique author identifiers. This year
  we have had many discussions about author identifiers (including
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder">this
  blog</ext-link> and at the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/08/23/thoughts-on-the-science-online-london-conference">Science
  Online London Conference</ext-link>), and I hope that in 2010 we will
  finally see an evolving standard that is picked up by journal
  publishers. It would be in the interest of PLoS to combine their
  article-level metrics with an author identifier as soon as possible,
  most likely the proposed CrossRef ContributorID, rather than the
  Elsevier Scopus Author Identifier or the Thomson Reuters Researcher
  ID.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="article-level-metrics-should-enhance-literature-searches">
  <title>Article-level metrics should enhance literature
  searches</title>
  <p>We all know how Google became the most popular search engine
  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103840/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">Pagerank</ext-link>).
  And article usage data would be a tremendous boost for scientific
  literature databases such as PubMed. A literature search should sort
  the results by usage data (e.g. a combination of number of citations,
  HTML views and PDF downloads) rand not the rather boring publication
  date, author or journal name. Normally I would think that
  <italic><italic>Google Scholar</italic></italic> would be the first
  place to implement such a functionality, but I haven't seen much
  innovation from Google Scholar lately.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="article-level-metrics-should-not-only-be-numbers">
  <title>Article-level metrics should not only be numbers</title>
  <p>As we don't want to reduce a paper to simple numbers, it is
  important to provide more than HTML views and PDF download counts.
  Citations counts are useful numbers, but linking to the citing papers
  is even more interesting. Similarly we want to see links to
  <italic><italic>Faculty of 1000</italic></italic> recommendations and
  blog posts aggregated at
  <italic><italic>ResearchBlogging.org</italic></italic>. If we extend
  this further, we should probably start to think about a better name
  for article-level metrics. And I hope we never start to call this
  ALM.</p>
