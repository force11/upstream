<p>There are many reasons to list all your publications online. Maybe
you are looking for a new job or want to attract students to start their
PhD in your lab. Usually you find this information on the home page of
your laboratory or department, but several tools can automate this
process.</p>
<sec id="nature-network">
  <title>Nature Network</title>
  <p>You can list your publications in your Nature Network profile.
  Simply add the DOI or Pubmed ID in the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://network.nature.com/publications/new">form</ext-link>
  provided. (Some of) my publications are listed
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://network.nature.com/profile/mfenner/publications">here</ext-link>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="facebook">
  <title>Facebook</title>
  <p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</ext-link>
  has a similar feature for those unfortunate souls not yet on Nature
  Network. Use the Facebook application
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://apps.facebook.com/medlinepublications/">Medline
  Publications</ext-link>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="google-scholar">
  <title>Google Scholar</title>
  <p>Only Facebook members can see your Medline publications. But
  everybody can use Google Scholar. My publications are listed
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=de&amp;lr=&amp;q=autor%3A%22mh+fenner%22">here</ext-link>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="pubmed">
  <title>Pubmed</title>
  <p>Why not use the original? Use the search term “Fenner MH”[Author].
  My publications are listed
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=Search&amp;Term=%22Fenner%20MH%22%5BAuthor%5D">here</ext-link>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="scopus">
  <title>Scopus</title>
  <p>Searches in Google Scholar and Pubmed search by name. This means
  that the links above don't work if your name is not unique.
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</ext-link>
  uses a unique author ID to overcome these problems. My author ID:
  7006600833 and 7006600825. If you have more than one author ID (as in
  my case), you can ask Scopus to merge them together into one author
  ID. Scopus also provides an
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://searchapidocs.scopus.com/">API</ext-link>
  to create mashups with other data. One example is
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://info.scopus.com/scsearchapi/geoCitations/index.html">this</ext-link>
  mashup with Google Maps that shows a map of the most highly cited
  papers by subject area. The problem with Scopus? You have to sign up
  for a user account to use Scopus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="researcherid">
  <title>ResearcherID</title>
  <p>The new kid on the block. ResearcherID is currently only available
  to
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://isiwebofknowledge.com/">ISI
  Web of Knowledge</ext-link> users, for all others it is invitation
  only. But everybody can access your publications. My researcherID is
  A-7225-2008 and the list of my publications can be found
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://www.researcherid.com:80/rid/A-7225-2008">here</ext-link>.</p>
  <p>The problem with ResearcherID? ResearcherID is tightly integrated
  with other Thomson Scientific products. You need a ISI Web of
  Knowledge account to add papers, Or you can import your citations from
  a RIS file, a file format from the Thomson Scientific
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://www.refman.com/">Reference
  Manager</ext-link>.</p>
  <p>As you can see, all these tools have their shortcomings. Pubmed and
  Google Scholar fall short, because searching by name just doesn't
  work. Scopus and ResearcherID are nice and provide additional
  features, e.g. the Hirsch number or citations of your papers. But the
  commercial interests of Elsevier and Thomson Scientific have
  introduced important limitations.</p>
  <p>So for the time being, the best tool is <italic><italic>Nature
  Network</italic></italic>. And there is great potential for
  improvements, e.g. integration with
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://www.connotea.org/">Connotea</ext-link>
  or linking to coauthors that are also Nature Network members.</p>
  <p>In related news, Ian Mulvany today announced on his Nature Network
  blog that Connotea is now
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611110316/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/U3DF456C6/2008/02/22/connotea-is-now-openid-enabled">OpenID
  enabled</ext-link>.</p>
