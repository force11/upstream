<p>The best and quickest discussions of a scientific paper now sometimes
happen in science blogs rather than in the peer-reviewed literature.
Whereas we have a number of scholarly databases that track citations
between papers, we don’t have the same tools for science blogs.
Following all science blogs manually has simply become impossible
(unless your first name is
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://coturnix.org/">Bora</ext-link>).
This makes it difficult to find all blog posts about a particular paper
 - either for

  <title>Microformats</title>
  <p>Microformats are an alternative – but of course complimentary –
  strategy. Microformats are small snippets of HTML that represent
  commonly published things. A good example is
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-license">Rel-License</ext-link>,
  a microformat indicating licensed content:</p>
  <preformat>&lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot; rel=&quot;license&quot;&gt;cc by 2.0&lt;/a&gt;</preformat>
  <p>In February Google
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://microformats.org/2011/02/24/google-launches-microformat-powered-recipe-search">launched</ext-link>
  a new Recipe view feature based on the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://microformats.org/wiki/hrecipe">hRecipe</ext-link>
  microformat, demonstrating how microformats can help discovering
  content. There is currently no
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/03/14/scholarly-html-%E2%80%93-major-progress/">standard
  microformat for scholarly citations</ext-link>. The simplest format
  would again use the <bold><bold>rel</bold></bold> tag – together with
  the Citation Typing Ontology
  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/02/14/how-to-use-citation-typing-ontology-cito-in-your-blog-posts/">CiTO</ext-link>):</p>
  <preformat>&lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1197258&quot; rel=&quot;cito:discusses&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;</preformat>
  <p>There are
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/1/S1/S6/table/T1">more
  than 20</ext-link> CiTO tags for describing what we think about a
  particular paper or science blog post – many science bloggers would
  probably have used <italic><italic>cito:critiques</italic></italic>
  for the above paper. I suggest
  <italic><italic>cito:discusses</italic></italic> as the standard CiTO
  relationship for most papers and blog posts. You can add this tag
  manually, or use a tool such as the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525235200/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/link-to-link/">Link

  <italic><italic>cito:discusses</italic></italic> to version
  1.1.2).</p>
