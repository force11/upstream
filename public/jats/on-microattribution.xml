Online London Conference</ext-link> later this week I will moderate a

Edmunds</ext-link>. I thought that microattribution would be an
established concept, so I was surprised to find so little information
about it. Wikipedia
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microattribution&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">doesn’t
know</ext-link> about microattribution. A search in PubMed retrieves
only two hits (the 2011 <italic><italic>Nature
Genetics</italic></italic> paper mentioned below and an editorial in the
same issue). One of the first mentions of the term appears to be an
August 2007 Editorial in <italic><italic>Nature
Genetics</italic></italic>
(<bold><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng0807-931">Compete,
collaborate, compel</ext-link></bold></bold>), but at the time the term
also included what we today would call data citation. It therefore might
be a good idea to try a definition:</p>
<p specific-use="wrapper">
  <disp-quote>
    <p>Microattribution ascribes a small scholarly contribution to a
    particular author.</p>
  </disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Important for this definition is the <bold><bold>small scholarly
contribution</bold></bold>, which until now we have been unable to
appropriately associate with its contributor. This scholarly
contribution is too small to merit a scholarly paper or publication as
dataset. And in most cases we have not bothered to provide unique
identifiers for the scholarly contribution and/or the author.</p>
<p>A very good example for where microattribution can be valuable is the
description of genetic variation. A March 2011 <italic><italic>Nature
Genetics</italic></italic> paper
(<bold><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.785">Systematic
documentation and analysis of human genetic variation in
hemoglobinopathies using the microattribution
approach</ext-link>)</bold></bold> concluded that microattribution
<italic><italic>demonstrably increased the reporting of human variants,
leading to a comprehensive online resource for systematically describing
human genetic variation</italic></italic>. One example described in the
paper is the genetic variation in the promoter of the KLF1 erythroid
transcription factor, explaining differences in the level of fetal
hemoglobin (HbF). Most of these variants were never published in a paper
(the blue squares in the figure).</p>

<p>For the first time we now seem to have both the technology and
willingness to enable microattributions on a large scale. There will be
ample time for discussion in the microattribution session on Friday, but
I’m personally most interested in the next practical steps to move
microattribution forward. My background is unique author identifiers
(ORCID) and my co-moderators bring in their experience with Wikipedia
(Mike Peel), science blog aggregation (Bora Zivkovic) and crowdsourcing
of sequencing efforts (Scott Edmunds). Some of the questions that I
would like to address in the session are:</p>
<list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
    <p>Should all microattribution information be collected in one,
    several or many places?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Do we need one, several or many identifier schemes for
    contributions and authors?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>What level of detail should we allow for microattributions?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Should microattributions use persistent identifiers?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Can and should we keep our scholarly contributions separate from
    other contributions?</p>
  </list-item>
</list>

<p><italic><italic>My simplified view of the scholarly record,
updated</italic></italic></p>
<p>I
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610133410/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/scientific-attribution-principles/">have
said before</ext-link> that I think that attribution should be separated
from evaluation, and I think is also true for microattribution. The main
reason is that evaluation is something we still know very little about,
and a scholarly record available to everybody will make it much easier
to make progress here. I don’t think anybody knows yet what
distinguishes a good from a bad microattribution, or whether it is
possible to compare the scientific impact of 10 or 100 microattributions
to one scholarly paper.</p>
