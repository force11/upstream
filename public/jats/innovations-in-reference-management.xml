<p>Earlier today I attended the fabulous

also find a good number of interesting tweets under the hashtag

My presentation was called <italic><italic>Trends in Reference
Management</italic></italic>:</p>
<p>I started my presentation by giving a brief historical perspective on
how reference management has evolved during the past 25 years. It seems
as if many users today use reference managers the same way as users did
in 1992 (when
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci00010a601">this
review of Endnote</ext-link> was written): a database of (mostly)
journal articles installed on your desktop computer that can fetch
references directly from online databases (in 1992 we had Endlink and
the Z39.50 protocol for that) and that inserts bibliographies into
Microsoft Word. It is odd that many seemingly old problems still exist
today:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>Digital Object Identifiers
    (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.doi.org/">DOIs</ext-link>)
    were introduced in 2000, and many journals not only are using them,
    but also exist only as electronic versions. Nevertheless most
    citation styles still use volumes, issues and page numbers instead
    of the DOI. And some journals and online databases (e.g. PubMed)
    still don’t display the DOI prominently, but rather use their own
    numbering scheme.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Most reference managers allow sharing of reference in private or
    public groups. We have collaborative writing tools (Google Docs,
    Zoho Writer, Adobe Buzzword, and now even
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://workspace.officelive.com/">Microsoft
    Office Live Workspace</ext-link>) since at least 2006, but I think
    that no reference manager supports them beyond a simple copy and
    past function.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Almost all journal articles can be downloaded as PDF files, but
    users are still confused what they are allowed to do with these
    PDFs. Many publishers don’t even allow redistribution of these PDFs
    within an institution (e.g. for a journal club), something that is
    probably often ignored. These problems obviously don’t exist for
    Open Access publications, but it again gets complicated with those
    publishers that use a
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Creative
    Commons Noncommercial license</ext-link>. And to the best of my
    knowledge, no reference manager is providing copyright information
    for its references.</p>

  <title>Mobile Applications for Reference Management</title>
  <p>In the next part of my presentation I briefly talked about some of
  the mobile applications handling scientific journal articles

  The small screen of mobile phones makes it difficult to read
  scientific papers (especially the tables and figures). The best use
  case is probably the scanning of journal table of contents or search
  alerts with bookmarking of interesting papers for later reading. In
  other words, a perfect job for a RSS reader synchronized with the
  desktop.</p>
  <p>The iPad is a very different story, as for me it is a very good
  device for reading a scientific paper – better than a desktop computer
  and even better than a printout if you don’t have a color printer. And

  especially if you also own Papers for Mac and can simply transfer all
  your PDF files complete with reference information to the iPad.</p>

  <p>I then moved on to give a brief introduction to the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</ext-link>
  initiative (most of my slides were kindly provided my
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.slideshare.net/CrossRef/crossref-contributor-id">Geoff
  Bilder</ext-link> and
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.slideshare.net/hratner/introduction-to-orcid-stm-spring-2010">Howard
  Ratner</ext-link>). Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID aims to
  provide a universal unique identifier for researchers. Past approaches
  have not gained universal acceptance because they were restricted to a
  particular discipline (e.g.
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.repec.org/">RePEec</ext-link>),
  country (e.g.
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.slideshare.net/amandahill/names-project-update">Names
  Project</ext-link>) or were started by a single private company (e.g.
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://info.scopus.com/scopus-in-detail/tools/authoridentifier/">Scopus
  Author Identifier</ext-link>). ORCID is a broad initiative with
  already more than 100
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.orcid.org/gallery.php">participating
  organizations</ext-link>. ORCID
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/462825a">was
  announced</ext-link> in December 2009, and the initiative is currently
  working hard to first incorporate as a non-profit organization and
  then launch a first public prototype (based on the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611100639/http://www.researcherid.com:80/Home.action">ResearcherID</ext-link>
  software). Both milestones are planned for later this year.</p>
  <p>Reference managers will of course benefit from a widely accepted
  author identifier, e.g. by making it much easier to find all
  publications from a particular author. ORCID can also be used to track
  other scientific contributions, e.g. peer review, blog posts,
  presentations or primary research datasets. Reference managers could
  also track (some of) these contributions by researchers.</p>
