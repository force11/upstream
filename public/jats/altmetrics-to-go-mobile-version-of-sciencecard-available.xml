<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</ext-link>
is a web service that collects all scientific articles published by an
author and displays their aggregate article-level metrics. Yesterday I
added a mobile version to ScienceCard, simply browse to ScienceCard with
your mobile phone or go to
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://mobile.sciencecard.org/">http://mobile.sciencecard.org</ext-link>.
This is a first version based on my work with jQuery Mobile on
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/01/04/crowdometer-goes-mobile/">CrowdoMeter</ext-link>,
but I think ScienceCard works really well on a small screen.My
ScienceCard looks like
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://mobile.sciencecard.org/mfenner">this</ext-link>.
Further down the screen are the articles I have published and the
collective metrics of these papers.</p>

</fig>
<p>Other ScienceCard users have much more impressive metrics, both in
traditional citations, and in altmetrics such as PDF downloads of papers
published with PLoS:</p>

<p>Metrics of an individual paper
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751/http://doi.org/dm9">http://doi.org/dm9</ext-link>),
with links to the journal and metrics (e.g. CiteULike bookmarks) look
like this:</p>
<fig>
  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000751im_/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/files/2012/01/sciencecard.png" xlink:title="sciencecard" />
</fig>
<p>One idea behind ScienceCard is to make the collection and display of
this kind of information as simple as possible. I hope this is another
small step in the right direction.</p>
