<p>The 2008 Nobel Prizes will be announced next week, starting with the
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday. There will be a live
webcast on Monday at 9:30 AM GMT for those
interested<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn1">1</ext-link></sup>.
As every year just before the announcement, speculation about this
year's winners is in full swing.

last year's
winners<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn2">2</ext-link></sup>,
and this year he is trying it
again<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn3">3</ext-link></sup>.

<p>There will be of course many more blog posts about the Nobel Prizes
this week, both on Nature
Network<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn5">5</ext-link></sup>
and elsewhere. But in this blog post I want to talk about someone who
will not win a Nobel Prize, but who would very much have deserved to do
so. I am talking about <italic><italic>Judah Folkman</italic></italic>
who invented the field of angiogenesis research and worked on it for
more than 35 years. But the prize can only be awarded to living people,
and Judah Folkman passed away this January. A
<italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic>
obiturary<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn6">6</ext-link></sup>
and recent <italic><italic>PNAS</italic></italic>
article<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn7">7</ext-link></sup>
summarize his life and scientific achievements. Here I want to explain
my personal reasons why I think he would have deserved a Nobel
Prize.</p>
<sec id="angiogenesis-reseach-is-hypothesis-driven">
  <title>Angiogenesis reseach is hypothesis-driven</title>
  <p>Folkman first published his concept of tumor angiogenesis in
  1971<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn8">8</ext-link></sup>.
  He postulated that the recruitment of dedicated blood vessels is
  essential to tumor growth. It took 25 years of experimental work by
  Folkman and others until the concept of angiogenesis became widely
  accepted. Interestingly, another hypothesis that changed our
  understanding of cancer biology was also published that year:
  Knudson's two-hit hypothesis of tumor suppressor
  genes<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn9">9</ext-link></sup>.
  Judah Folkman often said <italic><italic>Science goes where you
  imagine it.</italic></italic> A lot of today's research is not at all
  about proving an important hypothesis, and some people even mistakenly
  propose that concepts are no longer
  needed<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn10">10</ext-link></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="angiogenesis-research-is-full-of-failures">
  <title>Angiogenesis research is full of failures</title>
  <p>The story of angiogenesis research is a very complicated one. Not
  only took it Judah Folkman a long time and a lot of subbornness before
  his views became accepted, but there were many failures and setbacks
  along the way. Some scientific breakthroughs were an instant success,
  e.g. RNA interference awarded a Nobel Prize in
  2006<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn11">11</ext-link></sup>,
  but most research is just very complicated, including medical
  research. A September <italic><italic>Science</italic></italic>
  article about medical interventions found a median interval of 24
  years between first description and earliest highly cited
  article<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn12">12</ext-link></sup>.</p>

<sec id="angiogenesis-research-has-had-an-impact">
  <title>Angiogenesis research has had an impact</title>
  <p>The number of Pubmed citations is one good indicator for the
  research activity in a given field. Pubmed today lists 37,482
  publications about angiogenesis, including 19985 publications from the
  last five years. This compares favorably to research about telomerase
  (8040 publications), and microRNA (3541 publications), two areas of
  research mentioned in the discussions about potential 2008 winners.
  Impact can be also measured in other ways, but it is clear that the
  concept of angiogenesis has not only profoundly changed cancer
  research, but is also important in many other diseases, summarized in
  a 2005 <italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic>
  article<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn13">13</ext-link></sup>.</p>

  <p>As the name already suggests, the Nobel Prize for Physiology or
  Medicine is actually two prizes in one. It is a Nobel Prize in
  Biology, awarded for major achievements in our understanding of all
  aspects of biology. But is also a Nobel Prize in Medicine, where major
  advances in our understanding of human disease are awarded. The 2005
  Nobel Prize to Barry Marshall and Robin Warren for the role of
  Helicobacter pylori in gastric
  disease<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn14">14</ext-link></sup>
  is a good recent example of the latter category.
  The research by Folkman and others has changed the way we think about
  cancer, but also the way we treat cancer. Each year, more than one
  million patients with colon, lung or breast cancer are treated with
  the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab. Other drugs targeting angiogenesis
  are either already in clinical use (e.g. sunitinib for renal cancer)
  or in development. This makes angiogenesis research a prime example
  for translational research. I very much agree with the views expressed
  in a set of articles in <italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic> this
  June<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174101/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/10/05/someone_who_should_have_won_a_nobel_prize/#fn15">15</ext-link></sup>,
  that more has to be done to connect our much better understanding of
  fundamental biological processes to the way we diagnose, prevent and
  treat diseases. And a Nobel Prize would be a strong signal.</p>
