<p>In the last few weeks I haven’t seen any announcement for a new
science blogging network (the last one was probably
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://blog.coturnix.org/2010/09/15/alert-some-big-and-important-and-exciting-news/">Scientific
American</ext-link> in September). So I thought today would be a good
day to start a new one. Earlier today I wrote
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://blogs.mh-hannover.de/tumorzentrum/2010/10/15/herzlich-willkommen/">the
first post</ext-link> on the first blog hosted by
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://www.mh-hannover.de/index.php?id=2&amp;L=1">my
institution</ext-link>. The blog runs on a WordPress 3.0 installation
that I hope will see more blogs in the future – our library will
probably be next (they are currently
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://mhhbibliothek.wordpress.com/">hosted
on WordPress.com</ext-link>).</p>

<p>The new blog is the official blog of our Comprehensive Cancer Center
(my day job). I will write about various aspects of the work there –
something I wanted to do for a while. This is also the first time that I
write in German, which will be much easier, but at the same time will
reach a smaller audience. Writing for my institution will also be an
interesting experience. Although I don’t think that this will start
something big at our institution, institutions are in fact a good place
for blogging networks. Special thanks go to Stefan Zorn in our PR
department for encouraging words, and to
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101105204155/http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/about-the-authors/">Henry
Scowcroft</ext-link> from Cancer Research UK for many good tips about
blogging for an institution.</p>
<p>The new blog of course doesn’t mean that I stop writing here. I’m too
deep into this.</p>
