<p>The history of HTML begins 1989 at
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://info.cern.ch/">CERN</ext-link>,
the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva. <bold><bold>Tim
Berners-Lee</bold></bold>, <bold><bold>Robert Cailliau</bold></bold> and
colleagues invented HTML (as well as the transport protocol HTTP and the
web browser) to facilitate collaboration between CERN physicists.</p>

<p>HTML was originally invented for scholarly communication, but of
course by the mid-1990s was also used by everybody else. But when
electronic distribution of scholarly journal articles became possible,
most publishers switched to PDF instead of HTML as the electronic
document format of choice.</p>
<p>In April 2003 Inera, Mulberry Technologies and the NCBI published the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://www.inera.com/nlmresources.shtml">NLM
Journal Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite</ext-link> (NLM-DTD, read
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://old.diglib.org/preserve/hadtdfs.pdf">here</ext-link>
about the history of this DTD Suite). The NLM-DTD has become the de
facto XML standard for scholarly publishing and archiving. Although some
tools for authors can write articles in this format (including Microsoft
Word with the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2008/11/07/interview_with_pablo_fernicola/">Article
Authoring Add-In</ext-link>), the NLM-DTD has never caught on as an
authoring format for scholars and I’m not aware of any publisher
accepting manuscripts written in this format.</p>
<p>In April 2009  <italic><italic>Learned Publishing</italic></italic>
published a paper by <bold><bold>David Shotton</bold></bold> titled
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://dx.doi.org/10.1087/2009202">Semantic
publishing: the coming revolution in scientific journal
publishing</ext-link>. David listed six rules for semantic
publishers:</p>
<list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
    <p>Start simply and improve functionality incrementally.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Expect greater things of your authors.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Exploit your existing in-house skills fully.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Use established standards wherever possible.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Publish raw datasets to the Web.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Release article metadata, particularly reference lists, in
    machine-readable form.</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>Although the paper focusses on scholarly publishers, these rules also
very much apply to what we could call Scholarly HTML today.</p>
<p>At about the same time (March 31, 2009) <bold><bold>Peter
Sefton</bold></bold> for the first time used the term
<italic><italic>Scholarly HTML</italic></italic> in a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://ptsefton.com/2009/03/31/scholarly-html.htm">blog
post</ext-link>. He thinks that Scholarly HTML should allow the
following:</p>
<list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
    <p>Documents should definitely have headings.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Protocols for representing things like examples.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Metadata, using a linked data approach.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Links from terms mentioned in the text to ontologies that
    describe them.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Linkable paragraphs.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Dead simple reference management via links to trusted
    sources.</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>In January 2011 <bold><bold>Phil Bourne</bold></bold> organized the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/11/06/beyond-the-pdf-it-is-time-for-a-workshop/">Beyond
the PDF</ext-link> workshop, and I was lucky to attend. We had a number
of
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://river-valley.tv/conferences/beyondthepdf-2011">interesting
sessions</ext-link> about how to improve the current scholarly paper
published as PDF. I was involved in the working group thinking about
better authoring tools, and one of my personal conclusions was that
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">ePub</ext-link>
is a very interesting alternative to PDF if we need a packing format for
HTML, e.g. for journal submission or archiving.</p>
<p><bold><bold>Peter Murray-Rust</bold></bold> was able to capture the
ideas of the authoring working group with a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/02/09/scholarly-html-hackfest-cambridge-uk-march/">drawing</ext-link>,
and he picked the term <italic><italic>Scholarly HTML</italic></italic>
as the best description of what we want to achieve. He subsequently
invited Peter Sefton, Brian McMahon and me (and a number of other people
interested in Scholarly HTML) to a workshop that took place last weekend
in Cambridge. Some of the thoughts of Peter Murray-Rust and Peter Sefton
are summarized
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/03/14/scholarly-html-%e2%80%93-major-progress/">here</ext-link>
and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://ptsefton.com/2011/03/18/scholarly-html-fraglets-of-progress.htm">here</ext-link>.
Two outcomes of the workshop are Scholarly HTML
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://okfnpad.org/schtml-principles">Principles</ext-link>
and a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://okfnpad.org/schtml-faqs">FAQ</ext-link>.</p>
<p>My approach to Scholarly HTML is through developing WordPress
plugins. The future will hopefully bring of a number of Scholarly HTML
authoring tools, and WordPress will be just one of them. But Wordpress
is a great platform to test ideas and improve them over time, or to
quote David Shotton: <italic><italic>start simply and improve
functionality incrementally</italic></italic>. One starting point has
been citations in Scholarly HTML and we have already made
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610122136/http://okfnpad.org/schtml-citations">good
progress</ext-link>.</p>
<p>The idea behind Scholarly HTML is not to build alternatives for
Microsoft Word or LaTeX for authoring, but instead to build tools that
will allow us to do something new and exciting with scholarly content.
The trick here is to improve the scholarly document – and the author
should see the immediate benefit - without putting too much extra burden
on the author. And this might in fact be the big challenge for Scholarly
HTML.</p>
