<p>Reference managers are essential tools to read and write scholarly
papers. In the last few years we have seen both a number of new
reference managers (most of them web-based), but also a trend for the
established reference managers to gain social networking features. More
choice is great, but it also creates confusion about the right tool to
use. I have talked about reference managers

but in this slideshow I look at the features that I find important.</p>
<p>And there are at least two features that I like, but haven't really
seen implemented in a reference manager:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p><italic><italic>Integration of an RSS reader for journal table of
    contents (TOC)</italic></italic>. Currently I use a standard RSS
    reader, and it requires too many steps to get interesting references
    from a TOC into my reference manager.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><italic><italic>Tracking the post-publication
    discussion</italic></italic>. I want my reference manager to link to
    the papers that cite a particular reference (I currently use
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002030110/http://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</ext-link>
    for that) and link to
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002030110/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/04/28/faculty-of-1000-interview-with-richard-grant">Faculty
    of 1000</ext-link> or
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002030110/http://researchblogging.org/">ResearchBlogging.org</ext-link>
    comments on that paper.</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>In the last slide I wonder whether there is a) one perfect reference
manager, b) one perfect reference manager for my particular needs, or c)
I will always need more than one reference manager and have to move
references back and forth between them. Currently I'm at c), using
mostly Papers, Endnote and Connotea. But Mendeley, Zotero, Refworks and
Endnote are moving in a direction where they try to cover all
requirements.</p>
