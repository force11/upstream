<p>Dear Christian Specht,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055229/http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/57698/">your
detailed response</ext-link> in <italic><italic>The
Scientist</italic></italic> to
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055229/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/20/letter-to-the-scientist/">our
previous letter</ext-link> regarding citation mutations. You clarified
several issues that were raised in
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055229/http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/57689/">your
original study</ext-link>, particularly that citation mutation rates
have dropped significantly in the last 10 years (probably due to the
more widespread use of reference management software), and that some
citation mutations (e.g. 680→685 in Laemmli 1970) might be introduced
not by citing authors, but by the citation database.</p>
<p>You rightfully point out that citation mutations indicate a much
bigger problem: <italic><italic>authors often do not read the
publications cited in their work</italic></italic>. I am not aware of
any available direct data, but in an ongoing study Richard Grant is
looking at this question
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055229/http://blog.the-scientist.com/2010/09/23/mutatis-citandi/">Do
you read the papers you cite?</ext-link>). The preliminary data that
Richard kindly made available indicate that more than 85% of authors
indeed read the papers they cite.</p>
<p>In another study made aware to us by
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055229/http://twitter.com/noahWG/status/25410352261">Noah
Gray</ext-link>, Neale et al. (Neale 2009) used an elegant experimental
design to address the same question. They studied lethal acquired
mutations – retracted papers that in theory should no longer be cited –
as an estimate of how diligent authors were reading the papers they
cite.</p>
<p>The authors compared the number of citations of 102 retracted papers
(starting 12 months after the retraction) to a control group of papers
and found no difference in the average number of citations (26 vs. 27).
Content analysis of a subset of citing papers indicated that more than
50% of citations used the retracted paper to support their own findings
and less than 5% of citing papers mentioned the retraction.</p>
<p>These findings not only seem to contradict the preliminary findings
by Richard Grant, but also indicate that journal publishers and citation
databases may not be properly communicating paper retractions.</p>
