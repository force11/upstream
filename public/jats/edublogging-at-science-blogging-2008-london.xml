Blogging 2008: London</ext-link> conference will highlight the wide
variety of science blogging that has evolved in recent years. I haven't
seen anybody trying to create formal categories, but I see
<italic><italic>research blogging</italic></italic>,
<italic><italic>conference blogging</italic></italic>,
<italic><italic>watercooler blogging</italic></italic>,
<italic><italic>comic strip blogging</italic></italic> â€“ and
<italic><italic>edublogging</italic></italic>. Breakout session 5 of the
conference is called <italic><italic>Science blogs and online forums as
teaching tools</italic></italic>.

Marlow</ext-link> and myself will try to organize an interesting panel
discussion on the topic. Edublogging covers a wide range of topics, as
you can guess when looking at these (random) science education
blogs:</p>

<p>The last blog is especially interesting. It is hosted by
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://edublogs.org/">Edublogs</ext-link>.
They not only provide a hosting platform for teacher and student blogs,
but also offer special features that are especially useful for
educational blogging, e.g. managing and aggregating student blogs and
sharing material.</p>
<p>My interest in this topic started when we began the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611085429/http://network.nature.com/group/goodpaper">Good
Paper Journal Club</ext-link> here on Nature Network. Some questions I
would like to address in the session include:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>How are educators (professors, teachers, etc.) using blogs?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>How are students using blogs?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>How are science libraries using blogs?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Are there special features required for edublogging, e.g. team
    blogs, restricted access, sharing of documents?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Do university administrators facilitate blogging on
    education?</p>
