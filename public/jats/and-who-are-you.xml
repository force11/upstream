about how he interacts with his many, many blog readers</ext-link>. One

Wednesday asked the readers of his blog MicrobiologyBytes</ext-link> a
few questions. I like them and have blatantly reused most of them:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>Who are you and what’s your background?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>How long have you been reading Gobbledygook?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Where do you read Gobbledygook – website or RSS?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>What do you like best about Gobbledygook?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>How could I make Gobbledygook better for you?</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>It would be kind if you could provide some feedback in the comments
