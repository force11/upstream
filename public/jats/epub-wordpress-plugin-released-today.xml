<p>The
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132920/https://sites.google.com/site/beyondthepdf/">Beyond
the PDF</ext-link> workshop took place a little over a week ago. One
take-home message for me was that
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132920/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub">ePub
is a very interesting</ext-link> document format for scholarly
publishing and has several advantages over PDF. The workshop had a
wonderful spirit <italic><italic>to do something</italic></italic>, and
in this spirit I wrote a WordPress plugin that automatically creates
ePub files from blog posts. The plugin was
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132920/http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/epub-export">released
today</ext-link>, and can be installed directly from your WordPress
installation. A sample ePub can be downloaded from
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132920/http://blogs.xartrials.org/2011/01/09/embedding-adobe-illustrator-charts-in-wordpress-using-html5/">this
blog post</ext-link>, using the link at the bottom.</p>

<p>This is version 1.0 of the plugin, and there a still number of small
bugs, mainly because ePub is a complex format. A big problem is page
breaks, and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120628132920/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans">widows
and orphans</ext-link> can currently only be avoided by workarounds. You
can also see in the screenshot that the shortcode wasnâ€™t parsed for the
ePub.</p>
<p>But these are minor issues that can be solved in the coming weeks.
More interesting for version 1.1 is the inclusion of attachments (other
than images) in the ePub. I have to do some more thinking on how to do
this, especially how to handle all the possible mime types.</p>
<p>I like reading science blogs in ePub format, using either Adobe
Digital Editions on the Mac or iBooks on iPad and iPhone. This works
particularly well for longer posts, e.g. those lovely posts from my
science writer colleagues here on PLoS Blogs. If you have access to
WordPress, then this plugin is one of the easiest ways to produce
content in ePub format.</p>
