<p>The Yale University science libraries have decided to

their Biomed Central membership</ext-link>. Dramatically increasing page
charges are the reason behind this decision. Other

Central</ext-link> include the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), Brown University, The Jackson Laboratory, the drug
company Eli Lilly, University of Oxford, Cancer Research UK, EMBL and
DKFZ in Heidelberg, and many others.</p>
<p>The business model of Biomed Central and many other open access
puplishers relies on author charges to compensate for the costs to
publish a journal article. This is in contrast to the journal
subscription model of traditional publishers. Biomed Central membership
means that the author charges are picked up by the institution, just as
the institution traditionally pays for most journal subscriptions.</p>

that author charges are not the best way to compensate for the costs of
publishing a journal article, mainly because far fewer funding sources
have to come up for the costs of publishing an article.</p>
<p>Increasing article costs are a driving force behind the open access
movement (copyright retention by the author is the other important
factor). The real cost for publishing an article is very difficult to
calculate. For example, peer review is traditionally not paid for even
though it is central to the publication process. The indirect costs of
producing an article have moved more and more to the author, as
electronic submissions now frequently require a lot of formatting and
other pre-publishing work.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the publication cost should be put into perspective
to the total cost of a research project. In almost all cases, the
publication cost will be just a small fraction of the work hours,
equipment and reagents that were needed to submit the paper in the first
place.</p>
