<p>The 3rd Annual
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/">Science
Online London Conference</ext-link> took place last Friday and Saturday.
For me it was again a fantastic event. Matt Brown is collecting all blog
posts, pictures, videos, etc. over at
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://blogs.nature.com/u6e5b2ce1/2010/09/05/science-online-london-2010-index-of-blog-posts-videos-photos-and-stuff">this
Nature Network post</ext-link>. As one of the organizers of the
conference (mainly helping with the program) I was pretty nervous, and I
have to admit that I didn’t sleep well Thursday and Friday. And much
better Saturday.</p>

<p>One important reason to go to a conference is of course to meet the
members of your community in real life. It was great to talk to many old
friends again, and to meet for the first time in person people I knew
from online interactions (Alex Knoll, Brian Mossop, David Dobbs, Matt
Cockerill, Jen Mellinn, William Gunn and Jim Caryl and many others not
mentioned here). Of course I also missed several friends that came to
the first two conferences.</p>
<p>Of the many impressions of the conference I want to focus on one:
<bold><bold>Twitter</bold></bold>.</p>
<p>Twitter has of course become a mainstream tool to follow conferences.
Microblogging for the 2008 conference happened mainly on FriendFeed (the
much better tool for conference microblogging and described in this

Comp Biol</ext-link></italic></italic> paper). Every year has seen an
increase in Twitter use, and both

(#scio10) in January and

week’s conference</ext-link> produced more than 6000 tweets. Towards the
end of the conference on Saturday the #solo10 hashtag was the

trend</ext-link> for London, right before #happbirthdaybeyonce. People
not attending the conference were starting to drop in the conversation.
We easily beat mainstream science conferences such as the American
Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting (#asco10) that I

earlier this year</ext-link> (almost 5000 tweets, but more than 30.000
attendees). Also interesting: more than 700 people used the #solo10
hashtag in their tweets, even though the conference had only 250
attendees (at least 140 of them with Twitter accounts, listed

And some of those not attending were very active twitterers,
particularly Bora Zivkovic (@BoraZ).</p>

a Wordle with the conference tweets, which gives a good idea of the
topics discussed. The word PDF is a good example.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524054709/http://www.mjrobbins.net/">Martin
Robbins</ext-link> said in the <bold><bold>Rebooting Science
Journalism</bold></bold> panel discussion that “The PDF is an insult to
science…” (rightfully so), and this resulted in a longer discussion in
the Twitter backchannel.</p>
<p>That

panel discussion</ext-link> also made the best use of Twitter as
integral part of a session.

Ottery</ext-link> was monitoring the Twitter feed and provided feedback
for the panelists. We used Twitterwalls for most sessions, but the
speakers often did not use information.</p>

<p>Twitter several times was also mentioned as an important discovery
tool, and I agree that it has become of the best tools to discover
interesting stuff, blog posts, papers, etc. I couldn’t attend the
<bold><bold>Recommendation Tools for Scientists</bold></bold> session
(with Kevin Emamy and Jason Hoyt), so I don’t know whether Twitter as
recommendation tool was discussed there.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to do a more detailed analysis of the #solo10
tweets, e.g. by analyzing which sessions were the most tweeted, what
were the most popular keywords and links, or by categorizing tweets into
different categories. This could make an interesting session at the

visualization tricks that
