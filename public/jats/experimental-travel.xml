<p>Today is
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612091432/http://www.worldbookday.com/">World
Book Day</ext-link>, at least in the United Kingdom. So I wantd to join
my fellow NN Bloggers in our newest
<italic><italic>SynchroBlogging</italic></italic> effort and wrote this
post about science and books. I decided to write about the last book I
bought – which was yesterday.</p>
<p>The book is in German and is called <italic><italic>Italien – Kurzes
Reisehandbuch von Karl Baedeker</italic></italic>. The Baedeker series
of travel guides (this one is about Italy) is still popular, but was
started around 150 years ago. My book is the third edition and was
printed in 1895. I will be travelling to the Amalfi Coast near Naples
for my Easter holiday and I thought this would be a good opportunity to
do some exprimental tourism.</p>

Travel</ext-link> is an playful new way of traveling that I learned
about exactly one year ago on March 6 (another good reason for this
post) when I bought

book – in a bookstore in Auckland on my first vacation day in New
Zealand. The books describes many travel experiments and laboratory
results, including</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p><italic><italic>Airport tourism</italic></italic>. Spend 24 hours
    in an airport without getting on a plane</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><italic><italic>Confluence seeking</italic></italic>. Visit
    ordered points such as exactly 35° S / 117° E using a GPS device</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><italic><italic>Mascot travel</italic></italic>. Take pictures of
    your mascot outside famous landmarks, made famous by the French
    movie
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612091432/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/244109/Am-lie/overview">Amelie</ext-link>.</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>The experiment I wanted to do since reading this book was historic
travel, i.e. traveling with the help of a guidebook from a different
time. Italy is perfect for that, because my 1895 guidebook can still be
very useful for many places I will be visiting.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612091432/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompei">Pompei</ext-link>
is a good example. I will try to write lab notes and report on the
outcome of the experiment.</p>
