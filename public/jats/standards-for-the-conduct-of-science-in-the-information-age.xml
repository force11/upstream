<p>Assuming our airports are again open next weekend, I will be
attending a meeting organized by the

(National Science Foundation) and

(European Heads of Research Councils) on <italic><italic>Changing the
Conduct of Science in the Information Age</italic></italic> in
Washington on April 26. We have been asked to submit a one page white
paper in advance of the
meeting.<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/04/17/improving_the_conduct_of_science/#fn1">1</ext-link></sup>
I decided to focus on the importance of standards, obviously leaving out
many other important technological and social aspects. But defining and
adhering to standards will enable or enhance a number of very
interesting ways to conduct and report science in the information
age.</p>

<p>Improving the conduct of science through digital technology requires
standards for linking to and formatting scholarly resources. These
standards should be coordinated by independent organizations that are
not restricted to geographic areas or particular research domains.</p>

  <p>Digital Object Identifiers
  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.doi.org/">DOIs</ext-link>)
  are the primary system to link to digital content. The International
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</ext-link>
  initiative is the DOI registration agency for scientific primary data.
  Although there are many uses of DOIs for primary research data (e.g.
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.pangaea.de/">PANGAEA</ext-link>,
  earth system research), many systems still use different identifiers.
  Research funders and journals working in specific domains should
  collaborate on standards and best practices for primary research
  datasets, and journal publishers should encourage or even require
  linking to research datasets from publications. Successful examples
  include
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/">GenBank</ext-link>
  (genetic sequences) and

  (microarray gene expression).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="knowledge-access">
  <title>Knowledge access</title>
  <p>DOIs have become the standard identifier for electronic scholarly
  publications and are managed by the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</ext-link>
  registration agency. Journal articles, databases and websites linking
  to scholarly publications should use DOIs whenever possible instead of
  internal identifiers such as the PubMed ID or direct links to
  publisher webpages. Publishers should implement citation styles that
  use the DOI instead of volume, issue and page numbers.
  The
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM
  DTD</ext-link> is the standard format used by PubMed Central and many
  scholarly publishers to produce content for reading in the HTML, PDF
  or ePub formats. The
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/tc/scholarly_communication.mspx">Article

  allow researchers to produce content in the NLM DTD format. The
  workflow of writing, reviewing and publishing scientific papers should
  be based completely on the NLM DTD and tools for collaborative
  writing, journal submission and peer review should be build around
  that format.</p>

  Open Researcher and Contributor ID
  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</ext-link>)
  is one of many initiatives for a unique researcher identifier, but has
  probably the broadest support among institutions, publishers and
  research organizations. ORCID will be managed by an independent
  non-profit organization, and will allow the exchange of profiles with
  other researcher identifier systems such as those used by
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</ext-link>,
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://repec.org/">RePEc</ext-link>,
  or

  The information in the author profile may be initially provided by an
  institution, society or publisher, but should eventually be claimed by
  the individual researcher because of privacy concerns and because
  automated author disambiguation is never 100% accurate. Attribution
  should include all aspects of scholarly activity, including curation
  of primary research datasets and peer review.
  The Public Library of Science (PLoS)
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093752/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">article-level
  metrics</ext-link> make available comprehensive information
  (citations, downloads, social bookmarks, comments, etc.) with every
  published article. This system should be linked to author identifiers
  and developed into a standard for scholarly resources. Other scholarly
  publishers and databases for primary research data should then adopt
  these metrics.</p>
