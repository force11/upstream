<p>In December Euan Adie and I
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/12/20/crowdometer-or-trying-to-understand-tweets-about-journal-papers/">started
the CrowdoMeter projec</ext-link>t, an analysis of the semantic content
of tweets linking to scholarly papers. Because classifying almost 500
tweets is a lot of work, we turned this into a crowdsourcing project. We
got help from 36 people, who did 953 classifications, and we discussed
the preliminary results (available
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://crowdometer.org/ratings">here</ext-link>)

conference.</p>
<p>There is no reason to stop the crowdsourcing here, so we have

the result set</ext-link> to
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/02/16/figshare-interview-with-mark-hahnel/">figshare</ext-link>
and invite everybody to help us with the data analysis. For this purpose
I have created a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/https://github.com/mfenner/crowdometer">public
repository</ext-link> on Github which contains not only the source code
for the CrowdoMeter website, but also all data – the same dataset made
available on figshare. I have written a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/https://github.com/mfenner/crowdometer/blob/crowdometer/public/assets/shares_author.R">first
R script</ext-link> that produces the following pie chart:</p>

</fig>
<p>The figure doesn’t look all that exciting, but there is some
calculation involved. There are different numbers of classifications per
tweet and sometimes there is disagreement: true means at least 50% of
classifications were true. It would be great if we find people willing
to help with data analysis, preferably using
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://rstudio.org/">R</ext-link>
and contributing their scripts to the Github repository. Please send me
an email or contact me
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027000313/http://twitter.com/#!/mfenner">via
Twitter</ext-link> if you need write access to the repository.</p>
