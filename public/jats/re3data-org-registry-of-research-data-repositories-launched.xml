<p>Earlier this week re3data.org – the Registry of Research Data
Repositories –
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029050202/http://www.re3data.org/2013/05/re3data-org-launched/">officially
launched</ext-link>. The registry is nicely described in a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029050202/http://dx.doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.21v1">preprint</ext-link>
also published this week.</p>
<p><italic>re3data.org offers researchers, funding organizations,
libraries and publishers and overview of the heterogeneous research data
repository landscape. Information icons help researchers to identify an
adequate repository for the storage and reuse of their
data.</italic></p>
<p>I really like re3data.org, and that is not because I personally know
several of the people involved in this project, or because they
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029050202/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/02/16/figshare-interview-with-mark-hahnel/">cited
this blog</ext-link> in their preprint. I think that we are just at the
beginning of building the infrastructure needed for research data
management, and re3data.org fills an important need. In my opinion it is
not enough to provide lists of research data repositories, we need
additional information that can help guide researchers in selecting an
appropriate research data repository. re3data.org has addressed this
nicely by providing a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029050202/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2013/06/01/re3data-org-registry-of-research-data-repositories-launched/10.2312/re3.002">vocabulary
for the registration and description of research data
repositories</ext-link>, and by creating a simple icon system:</p>

</fig>
<p><italic>Possible values for each icon. From
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029050202/http://dx.doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.21v1">http://dx.doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.21v1</ext-link></italic></p>
<p>Future directions I would like re3data.org to take include:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p><bold>Training and education.</bold> Researchers probably pick
    research data repositories mainly based on the familiarity of the
    repository within their community rather than the criteria developed
    by re3data.org. A lot more training and education is needed before
    researchers understand the importance of persistent identifiers,
    licenses and other criteria.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><bold>Integration.</bold> re3data.org can make it easier to
    integrate into existing scientific infrastructure, e.g. by using
    persistent identifiers such as DOIs for research data repositories,
    or by providing an API that makes it easier for other services to
    integrate re3data.org.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><bold>Governance</bold>. Whether or not scientific infrastructure
    such as re3data.org is accepted and used by the community depends on
    many factors, and governance is one of the most important ones.
    re3data.org should seek the support of other organizations, in
    particular from outside Germany. A governing board, re3data.org as
    an independent organization, and strategies to coordinate with
    similar efforts such as
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029050202/http://www.databib.org/">Databib</ext-link>
    are possible strategies.</p>
