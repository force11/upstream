<p>The

Online London 2011 Conference</ext-link> was a great event that took
place last Friday and Saturday. I was able to celebrate the first
<italic><italic>PLoS Blogs</italic></italic> anniversary together with
community manager <bold><bold>Brian Mossop</bold></bold>, but a detailed
conference post will follow later. The blog posts covering the event are
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://scienceonlinelondon.wikidot.com/coverage">here</ext-link>,
and the list is growing by the hour.</p>
<p>On Sunday a few brave souls met at the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</ext-link>
offices for the Science Online London hackathon to spend some time on a
cool programming project. We were greeted by <bold><bold>Victor
Henning</bold></bold> and <bold><bold>Jason Hoyt</bold></bold> and
quickly came up with a few good ideas. Jason finished work on
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://twendeley.ologeez.org/">Twendeley</ext-link>,
a cool Twitter/Mendeley mashup that looks for papers mentioned in your
Twitter stream and finds relevant articles in Mendeley. I wanted to do
some work on the PLoS
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://code.google.com/p/alt-metrics/">Article-Level
Metrics API</ext-link>.</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">Article-Level
Metrics</ext-link> looks at the usage and reach of an individual article
instead of using the <bold><bold>Journal Impact Factor</bold></bold> as
a proxy for the impact of a paper. The PLoS Article-Level Metrics API
provides access to some interesting numbers: not only citations, HTML
pageviews and PDF downloads, but also social metrics such as number of
bookmarks in CiteULike or number of readers in Mendeley.</p>
<p>But for the hackathon I was not interested in building a tool that
talks to the Article-Metrics API. On Sunday morning I had discovered
that the PLoS Article-Level Metrics server software is not only
available as Open Source software, but is built with <bold><bold>Ruby on
Rails</bold></bold>, a programming framework that I’m familiar with. So
I thought it would be fun to start improving the software by adding
metrics on the author level. And by building your own Article-Level
Metrics server, you are not limited to papers published in PLoS
journals, or to the kinds of metrics provided by PLoS. Wouldn’t it for
example be nice to also include download counts for
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://datadryad.org/">Dryad</ext-link>
datasets?</p>

</fig>
<p>With the help of <bold><bold>Kristi Holmes</bold></bold> and
<bold><bold>Cameron Neylon</bold></bold> we quickly got the API server
up and running, added a few papers and retrieved citation counts from
PubMed Central and the number of bookmarks from CiteULike (see above). A
few hours later we could add authors, and today I was able to
automatically import the first papers by author.</p>

<p>For author-level metrics we of course need a widely used unique
author identifier, and an API we can talk to. Otherwise author
disambiguation quickly becomes frustrating. Until
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</ext-link>
comes along next year, the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/mas/thread/9a23b2d6-6599-4853-acf5-c1692a64365e">Microsoft
Academic Search API</ext-link> looks like one of the best ways to
retrieve DOIs for papers published by a particular author.</p>
<p>The code for this project is available at
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610134729/http://github.com/mfenner/plos-alt-metrics">Github</ext-link>.
This obviously needs a lot more work, but it shouldn’t take more than a
few months to have the author part working properly and to find a host
for a server. And because this is an API server based on the PLoS code,
all tools that interact with the PLoS Article-Metrics server can use
this system immediately.</p>
<p>This service should make it a little bit easier to build a

trading card for scientists</ext-link>, or a dashboard of the

impact</ext-link> of your research.</p>
