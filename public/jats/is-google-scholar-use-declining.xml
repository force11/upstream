<p>I'm a regular reader of
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</ext-link>,
a popular blog about internet products and companies. But somehow I
missed the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/22/2007-in-numbers-igoogle-googles-homegrown-star-performer-this-year/">article</ext-link>
just before christmas that talks about the popularity of different
Google products. In this analysis, traffic for
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://scholar.google.com/">Google
Scholar</ext-link> was down 32% compared to 2006.</p>
<p>I haven't seen this information reproduced somewhere else, but the
number for most of the other Google products were higher than 2006, as
expected. And I don't have the numbers of searches in Google Scholar
compared to
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez">PubMed</ext-link>
(you would have to buy this information from companies like
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.comscore.com/">comScore</ext-link>).
But does this indicate that there is something wrong with Google
Scholar? As a PubMed user for 15 years, I still like to get search
results chronologically and not by (perceived) relevance. And I like the
detailed search options and integration with other databases.</p>
<p>Other search engines in this field include
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://scirus.com/">Scirus</ext-link>
from Elsevier and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://academic.live.com/">Windows
Live Academic Search</ext-link> from Microsoft. Incidentally, TechCrunch
(and others)
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/08/microsoft-has-announced-a-takeover-bid-for-fast-search-transfer-priced-at-12-billion/">reports</ext-link>
this week that Microsoft is about to acquire
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://www.fastsearch.com/">Fast
Search &amp; Transfer</ext-link>, the Norvegian company that provides
the search technology to Scirus.</p>
<p>Some big company names, but for me Pubmed is still the first stop
when searching for journal articles. And PubMed will become more
important as the NIH now
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611093258/http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/mfenner/2007/12/26/mandatory-open-access-for-nih-funded-research-signed-into-law">requires</ext-link>
the deposition of all NIH-funded research papers in PubMed Central.</p>
