<p><italic><bold>Conference 2.0</bold> – A scheduled meeting of people
sharing a common interest that takes advantage of Web
2.0<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn1"><bold>1</bold></ext-link></sup>
concepts.</italic></p>
<p>Scientific conferences are essential both for the exchange of ideas
and for networking. But they don’t have to be organized the same way as
10-20 years ago. Web 2.0 tools now allow much broader user participation
before, during and after the conference. Technology conferences have
seen this change
already<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn2"><bold>2</bold></ext-link></sup>.
We also already have open source software to organize
conferences<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn3"><bold>3</bold></ext-link></sup>.
I’ve collected a few of those ideas and concepts below.</p>
<p><bold>1. Keep the conference small</bold>
Active user participation works better in smaller conferences, e.g. not
more than maybe 150 participants (derived from Dunbar’s
number<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn4"><bold>4</bold></ext-link></sup>
introduced by
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/profile/duncan"><bold>Duncan
Hull</bold></ext-link>). This will exclude large or very large
conferences – the largest scientific conferences today have more than
10.000 participants. But those larger conferences can still adopt some
of the principles discussed below.</p>
<p><bold>2. Allow for user input to the conference program</bold>
Even though most scientific conferences ask for abstract submissions
well before the conference, the conference schedule is ultimately
decided my a small program committee. But conference organizers could
well ask for user input about session topics. In the BarCamp or
unconference format, the conference program is even decided on the first
day of the
conference<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn5"><bold>5</bold></ext-link></sup>.</p>
<p><bold>3. Provide free WiFi</bold>
This is essential for liveblogging about the conference. And free WiFi
in combination with a good conference website with detailed schedule,
message boards and practical information would greatly reduce the amount
of printed material that needs to be handed out at the conference.</p>
<p><bold>4. Set aside time for networking</bold>
There should be enough time (and space) between sessions to talk to the
other conference participants. After all, this is one main reason for
many people to attend a conference. And the conference organizers can
facilitate networking in other ways. Poster sessions (see below) are one
way, a very short introduction by every participant (either in person or
on the conference website) is another idea.</p>
<p><bold>5. Pay attention to poster sessions and discussions</bold>
Conferences can have other session formats than oral presentations.
Poster sessions are an often neglected part of many conferences. But
they are a great tool for networking, especially with younger
scientists. The conference organizers should set aside enough time and
avoid parallel oral sessions. Providing drinks and food also helps.
Round-table discussions are another underused format with a lot of
potential.</p>
<p><bold>6. Encourage blogging</bold>
There should be a clear policy regarding blogging stated at the
conference website. And this policy should make it easy for conference
participants to blog. This means no preregistration and no required
affiliation with a news service or journal. Conference organizers should
provide a tag for the conference so that blog entries can be
tracked.</p>
<p><italic>Blogging about the conference is encouraged by the conference
organizers. Please use the tag *conference</italic>name* for all your
blog posts. Please don’t blog about sessions marked
<bold>non_public</bold> in the conference program. They contain
information that should not become become public at this time, e.g.
because they discuss unpublished results. For further questions
regarding blogging at the conference, please contact …_</p>
<p>There are many different ways to blog about a conference,
microblogging via FriendFeed is currently a very popular
option<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn6"><bold>6</bold></ext-link></sup>.</p>
<p><bold>7. Produce podcasts</bold>
Podcasts with audio and video of the slides are a great way to capture
oral sessions at a conference. They are espcially valuable for those
unable to attend. This week’s <bold>Science in the 21st Century</bold>
conference is a good example of how this can be
done<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn7"><bold>7</bold></ext-link></sup>.</p>
<p><bold>8. Organize parallel local conferences</bold>
The costs and annoyances of traveling, combined with concerns about the
carbon
footprint<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn8"><bold>8</bold></ext-link></sup>
have led to new concepts. Instead of following the conference from the
distance via live-streaming or live-blogging, why not organize several
parallel local
conferences<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn9"><bold>9</bold></ext-link></sup>?
The Singularity web conference next month is using this
concept<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080929012015/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/12/its-time-for-conference-2-0#fn10"><bold>10</bold></ext-link></sup>.
Will the next science blogging conference happen in parallel in several
locations?</p>
