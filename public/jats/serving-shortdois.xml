<p>The shortDOI service was launched by the International DOI Foundation
(IDF) in May 2010. The service creates short versions of the often long
DOIs, e.g. <bold><bold>10/dvq</bold></bold> instead of
<bold><bold>10.1093/hmg/ddp202</bold></bold> – written as URL this would
be
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://doi.org/dvq">http://doi.org/dvq</ext-link>
instead of
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddp202">http://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddp202</ext-link>.
shortDOIs started as a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://labs.crossref.org/site/toi_dois.html">CrossRef
Labs project</ext-link> in 2009 and were originally named TOI DOI – TOI
stands for tiny object identifier. For a good introduction I recommend
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://go-to-hellman.blogspot.com/2010/05/long-handle-on-shortened-digital-object.html">Eric
Hellman’s blog post</ext-link> written in May 2010 when the shortDOI
service was launched.</p>

<p>shortDOIs provide exactly the same service as normal DOIs, i.e. they
redirect the user to the digital resource. They are convenient,
particularly for email and Twitter where space is limited. Links to
journal articles created by URL shorteners such as bit.ly or goo.gl look
similar, but require two redirects (first to dx.doi.org, then to the
journal article). But URL shorteners provide additional services to
users, e.g. customized links and usage statistics.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell shortDOIs have not become popular since the
service started more than a year ago. One important reason is certainly
that publishers are not really using them for their journal articles. I
don’t think many users will go through the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://shortdoi.org/">extra
steps creating a shortDOI</ext-link> just to use a DOI with Twitter –
the Twitter URL shortener t.co will do this automatically for them.
Michael Kuhn has created a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://blog.mckuhn.de/2011/02/bookmarklet-for-shortdoiorg.html">bookmarklet</ext-link>
that makes it a little bit easier to create shortDOIs. If we want
shortDOIs to ever become popular, then we should ask journal publishers,
bibliographic databases, reference managers and other places that
currently use DOIs to enable them.</p>
<p>Starting yesterday
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://sciencecard.org/">ScienceCard</ext-link>
is using shortDOIs instead of DOIs, and is also using the shortDOI to
link to individual articles on ScienceCard, e.g.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531234808/http://sciencecard.org/articles/dvq">http://sciencecard.org/articles/dvq</ext-link>.
Yesterday I’ve created about 750 shortDOIs for ScienceCard, and  this
probably already makes ScienceCard one of the larger shortDOI users. I
will decide in the coming months whether shortDOIs have improved the
ScienceCard service. A nice feature would for example be the
announcement of newly published papers via Twitter.</p>
