<p>The <bold>german academic international network
(GAIN)</bold><sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn1"><bold>1</bold></ext-link></sup>
informs German researchers working in North America about research
opportunities in Germany. The implied intention is to lure German
researchers back to Germany. GAIN project director Katja Simons
explains:</p>
<p><italic>Many german researchers abroad are highly interested in
returning but they need support creating networks and receiving
information on career opportunities in Germany. Germany has invested a
great deal in their education and is in need of these bright minds and
their experience they gained abroad.</italic></p>
<p>GAIN is a joint initiative by the <bold>Alexander von Humboldt
Foundation (AvH)</bold>, the <bold>German Academic Exchange Service
(DAAD)</bold> and the <bold>German Research Foundation (DFG)</bold>.
Their 8th annual meeting took place two weeks ago in
Boston<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn2"><bold>2</bold></ext-link></sup>.
More than 200 researchers working in North America participated,
together with representatives from many German research organizations,
including Matthias Kleiner, president of the German Research Foundation
(DFG)<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn3"><bold>3</bold></ext-link></sup>
and Margeret Wintermantel, president of the <bold>German Recotors’
Conference</bold> (HRK, the association of all higher education
institutions in
Germany)<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn4"><bold>4</bold></ext-link></sup>.
Representatives from business and politics (members of the parliament)
were also present.</p>
<p>To get a more personal perspective, I talked to two researchers that
attented the meeting.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/profile/avmaier"><bold>Alexander
Maier</bold></ext-link>, a research fellow at the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/affiliations/735"><bold>NIH</bold></ext-link>,
thinks that the GAIN meeting was a success. Sceptical at the beginning
of the conference, he acknowledges that things have changed and that
doing reseach in Germany has become much more attractive. The
<bold>excellence initiative</bold> by the German Government is one big
reason for that
change<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn5"><bold>5</bold></ext-link></sup>.
The most rewarding part of the program for him was the workshop on how
to apply for professorhips.</p>
<p>Florian Jaeger, an assistant professor from the University of
Rochester (his blog is
here<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn6"><bold>6</bold></ext-link></sup>)
is on the GAIN advisory board. He also got the impression that the
German reseach system is changing, and that</p>
<p><italic>Many institutions in Germany seem to be inspired to learn
from the positive aspects of the American system (and maybe even to
improve on it).</italic></p>
<p>But both Alexander and Florian felt that the research environment in
Germany is still far from perfect, and the German research organizations
should not think that all problems have been solved. Startup grants are
often relatively low and junior research groups are usually not as
independent as in the United States. And Florian thinks that the
research atmosphere – the way people interact and approach problems – is
still more stimulating in the United States.</p>
<p>Most reports about the GAIN meeting are in the German media,
including the newspapers Hamburger
Abendblatt<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn7"><bold>7</bold></ext-link></sup>
and Süddeutsche
Zeitung<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn8"><bold>8</bold></ext-link></sup>.
I found one blog post from a German postdoc attending the
meeting<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn9"><bold>9</bold></ext-link></sup>.
Nature Network is a good place to have a discussion not only about the
research environment in different countries, but also to learn more
about similar strategies carried out by other countries, e.g. France,
Italy, Japan or China. Feel free to leave your comments about why you
left your home country to do research somewhere
else<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn10"><bold>10</bold></ext-link></sup>,
or why you returned after finishing your PhD or
postdoc<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080921133726/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2008/09/19/how-to-lure-german-researchers-back-to-germany#fn11"><bold>11</bold></ext-link></sup>.</p>
