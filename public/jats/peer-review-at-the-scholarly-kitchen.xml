for Scholarly Publishing</ext-link> in 2008. The blog posts by authors
Kent Anderson, Phil Davis, David Crotty, Michael Clarke, etc. are an
always interesting – and often thought-provoking – read about scholarly
publishing. Two recent posts looked at peer review.</p>

“Burden” of Peer Review</ext-link>
In this blog post <bold><bold>David Crotty</bold></bold> argues that we
overestimate the amount of time the typical researcher spends doing peer
review. In his informal survey most researchers review 1-3 papers per
month, and those reviewing many more often do so voluntarily (e.g.
because they sit on an editorial board). I haven’t yet checked whether
there are any formal surveys on the workload of peer review.</p>

Review: Is the Dialog of Science Really a Monologue?</ext-link>
In August the BMJ
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525093945/http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.c3926">published

electronic letters to the editor. The cohort study found that authors
are reluctant to respond to criticism to their work. In a

<bold><bold>Philip David</bold></bold> summarized the two papers and

<p>I would disagree with Philip Davis about the conclusions that can be
drawn from the cohort study. We all know that many papers receive few if
any online comments. But we should rather think about where we could be
3-5 years from now, and how to get there. A recent editorial by Thomas
Liesegang in the <italic><italic>Journal of
Ophtalmology</italic></italic> is very relevant to this discussion

broader definition of post-publication peer review in a

to the BMJ editorial:</p>
<p specific-use="wrapper">
  <disp-quote>
    <p>I would define post-publication review as the process whereby
    scientists and others decide whether a piece of work matters or not.
    I suggest that this doesn’t happen much through debate in the
    correspondence pages of journals, but rather through scientists and
    other consumers of research recommending others to pay attention to
    a piece of research, conducting other studies off the back of it,
    absorbing it into systematic reviews, beginning to act on its
    conclusions, throwing it in the bin, and taking a thousand other
    actions that constitute the “market of ideas.”</p>
