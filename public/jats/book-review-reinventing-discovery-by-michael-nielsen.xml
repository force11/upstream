Discovery</ext-link>, the book by Michael Nielsen we all have been
waiting for, has finally been published on Friday. Today I flew to
Boston for the

Research eScience Workshop: Transforming Scholarly
Communication</ext-link>, and reading the book on the plane was the
perfect preparation for the workshop.</p>
<p>Michael says in the book:</p>

the chapter 1 as PDF</ext-link>, and you can also watch the videos of
two of his recent presentations:

Online London</ext-link> in September.</p>
<p>The book uses examples from science and related disciplines – e.g.
programming or chess – to examine both the opportunities and challenges
of doing Open Science. The book is good reading, because Michael is
aware of the many challenges that we face before science can be done
differently. One example for this is the peer-reviewed journal article
as the main currency to evaluate researchers. Until scientists are also
rewarded for producing or curating data, programming scientific
software, etc., we will not be able to start a new era of networked
science.</p>
<p>Highly recommended reading.</p>
<p>Timo Hannay has also written a

of the book</ext-link> for Nature Physics, and I’m sure we will soon see
many more.</p>
