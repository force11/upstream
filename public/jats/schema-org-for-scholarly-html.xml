<p>Last Thursday the search engines Google, Bing and Yahoo
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-schemaorg-search-engines.html">announced</ext-link>
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://schema.org/">schema.org</ext-link>,
a new initiative for structured data markup on the web. Websites that
use this schema to markup their data (more than 100 data types are
supported) will make it easier for the three largest web search engines
to find their content. Schema.org uses microdata, not microformats or
RDFa, according to the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://schema.org/docs/faq.html#15">FAQ</ext-link>
this was a pragmatic decision.</p>

<p>Schema.org also defines the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle">ScholarlyArticle</ext-link>,
but unfortunately this data type doesn’t add any properties beyond those
of the parent
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://schema.org/Article">Article</ext-link>
(e.g. the Digital Object Identifier). The
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://www.schema.org/Person">Person</ext-link>
data type is also interesting (and uses a professor as an example), but
for example doesn’t include an <bold><bold>isAuthor</bold></bold>
relationship.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see whether future versions of the
schema.org standard will have better support for scholarly content, and
how well this microformat can be integrated into our efforts to create
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://scholarlyhtml.org/">Scholarly
HTML</ext-link>. And how quickly scholarly publishers and other
providers of scholarly content will adopt this new standard., which in
its current form already is a big improvement over plain HTML.</p>
<p><italic>Update (6/7/11): Google today
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525041638/http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2011/06/authorship-markup-and-web-search.html">announced</ext-link>
support for authorship markup, either via the schema.org format or using
the <bold><bold>rel</bold></bold> attribute.</italic></p>
