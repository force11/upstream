<p>This Friday and Saturday the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london2013/">SpotOn
London Conference</ext-link> will take place at the British Library in
London. I am very excited, as I have come to this conference since the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://twitter.com/McDawg/status/397068628102610945">first
one in 2008</ext-link>, and have helped organize the event since 2009.
The conference is about science communication in the broadest sense, and
has three strands that focus on <italic>science communication, science
policy and tools</italic>. Equally important as the sessions are of
course the many highly engaging informal discussions of the 250
participants that take place between and after the sessions.</p>

  One of the projects in 2012 was a collaborative commenting system.

<p>SpotOn London sessions are also more conversations than
presentations, as they usually have 2-4 panelists with ample time for
discussion with the audience. I will take part in two panels:</p>

<p>I will summarize my thoughts regarding the altmetrics session in
another post, but want to talk about the first session in more detail.

    programmers and others involved in software development, including
    graphic designers, interface designers and project managers,
    collaborate intensively on software projects.</p>

<p>It is too bad that we will have no hackathon at year’s SpotOn London
for logistical reasons, but the session is a great opportunity to
reflect on the value of science hackdays. It is clear that hackdays for
scientific software have become popular, with almost too many
opportunities to participate.</p>

      <p>Hackdays are very much targeted at intermediate to advanced
      software developers, and it is sometimes not easy for beginners to
      participate</p>

    <list-item>
      <p>Too much time spent setting up stuff</p>

      <p>Not many projects make it beyond the hackday and actually turn
      into a useable product. One example where this is not true are the
      visualizations started at the ALM 2012 hackathon that were
      implemented by OJS in 2013
      (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/gha.v6i0.19283">see
      article for more</ext-link>), and of course
      <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://impactstory.org/">ImpactStory</ext-link>
      that started at a hackathon at the

  <title>Some ideas to improve science hackdays</title>

      <p>Go beyond software development. We
      <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blogs.plos.org/tech/alm-data-challenge-metrics-for-a-standard-set-of-dois/">recently
      tried a data challenge using Altmetrics data</ext-link>, and at a
      <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/07/02/auto-generating-links-to-data-and-resources/">hackathon
      between IGSN, DataCite, PANGAEA and ORCID in July</ext-link> we
      focussed on a high-level discussion of technical issues. There is
      a continuum towards the
      <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</ext-link>
      format, although I don’t like to drift too much from
      <italic>doing</italic> to <italic>talking</italic>. A good example
      of a workshop open to everyone and not just software developers is
      the SpotOn London workshop this Saturday on
      <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2013-wikipedia-editing-workshop/">Wikipedia

    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Meet before and after the hackathon. This can be done online,
      but it helps to focus on what can be achieved in the limited time
      available for a hackathon, and to follow up on projects that have
      just been started. But a hackathon is also a great opportunity to
      meet new people and new ideas, so meeting afterwards is more
      important than before.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p>Involve remote people. A lot of the fun of hackdays comes from
      sitting around a table and doing something together. But sometimes
      this is not possible for everyone, so think about remote
      participation where it makes sense.</p>
