<p>Last week I received email invitations from three different journals
to submit a research article. I should have felt flattered, but it is
unclear why it is me that received invitations to the journals
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103403/http://la-press.com/journal.php?journal_id=4"><italic>Biomarker
Insights</italic></ext-link>,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103403/http://la-press.com/journal.php?journal_id=103"><italic>Genomics
Insights</italic></ext-link> and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103403/http://www.medsci.org/"><italic>International
Journal of Medical Sciences</italic></ext-link>. All three journals
already exist for a few years, and I wouldn't say that the focus of my
research is biomarkers or genomics.</p>
<p>Then I thought about a recent blog post by Gunther Eysenbach:
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103403/http://gunther-eysenbach.blogspot.com/2008/03/black-sheep-among-open-access-journals.html">Black
sheep among Open Access Journals and Publishers</ext-link>. In this post
he calls the sending of unsolicited emails simply spamming and argues
that <italic><italic>there are also throw-away journals out there from
shady publishers trying to cash in on the current surge of interest in
open access publishing.</italic></italic></p>
<p>And this is what all three journals mentioned above have in common:
they are open access journals and the author pays for the (accepted)
article. It is obvious that any journal that gets paid by the author is
interested in soliciting articles whereas a subscriber-pays journal
would be interested in attracting new readers. There is nothing wrong
with this, but there are two potential problems. (1) Like most people I
don't like spam. (2) Journals with an author-pays business model have to
be extremely careful about the quality of their papers.</p>
<p>Potential authors should first check whether the journal (if it is a
biomedical journal) is indexed in
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103403/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=journals">Medline</ext-link>
(Genomics Insights is not) and either has a reasonable impact factor or
(for new journals) receives enough citations.</p>
