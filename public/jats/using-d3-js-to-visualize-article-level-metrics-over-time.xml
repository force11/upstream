<p>PLOS Article-Level Metrics (ALM) are a great set of data (available
via API and as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731170128/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/plos-alm-data/">monthly
data dump</ext-link>) for some nice data visualizations. I have recently
become a big fan of the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731170128/http://d3js.org/">d3.js</ext-link>
javascript library, and have now used d3 to look at some ALM data over
time.</p>
<p>I like simple visualizations without too many labels or axes, and
wanted to do a visualization inspired by
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731170128/http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR">sparklines</ext-link>
ever since we discussed this idea in our <italic>altviz</italic>
breakout group at the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731170128/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/alm-workshop-2012/hackathon/#altviz">ALM
workshop hackathon</ext-link> in November 2012 (kudos in particular to
Juan Alperin, Karthik Ram and Carl Boettiger). In the chart below every
column represents the numbers for a given month, with alternating colors
for the years (the article was published November 2009).</p>

<p>You can see a pattern that is probably typical for many articles
independent of the absolute numbers: most pageviews and downloads happen
in the weeks after publication, as does academic bookmarking and science
blogging.</p>
<p>The second example shows a very different pattern. This is not only
the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170731170128/http://alm.plos.org/sources/counter">most-downloaded</ext-link>
PLOS article, but Â the distribution of downloads over time is very
different, with the number of monthly downloads actually higher the last
two years (this article was published in August 2005). We also see a few
spikes in the usage stats, probably indicating events that triggered
usage. Academic bookmarking was most active from 2009 to 2011 and not
right after publication, although that might also have to do with the
relative popularity of CiteULike over time.</p>

<p>Citation data are unfortunately more difficult to get with exact
publication dates (why is that so difficult?), but we can at least look
at CrossRef numbers by year for the same article.</p>

<p>The citation numbers by year are still increasing (the last bar is
for 2013), indicating that this article is still of general interest 8
years after publication. This would probably be unusual for a life
sciences research article, but the article is an essay looking at common
pitfalls in the statistical analysis of research data.</p>
