<p>On Monday I was finally able to start the clinical trial
<bold><bold>Everolimus for patients with relapsed/refractory germ cell
cancer</bold></bold>
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185406/http://www.mh-hannover.de/studien/en/protocols/191.html">RADIT</ext-link>),
and I’m now looking forward to recruit the first patient. We aim to
treat 25 patients with cancer of the testis with the mTOR inhibitor
everolimus in this phase II trial, and eight German hospitals are
participating.</p>
<p>The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185406/http://www.icmje.org/publishing_10register.html">requires</ext-link>,
as a condition of consideration for publication in their journals,
registration in a public trials registry. I registered my trial with
Clinicaltrials.gov as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185406/http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01242631">NCT01242631</ext-link>.
The registration process was straightforward, especially compared to all
the other paperwork required for this trial.</p>
<p>The requirement for registration of clinical trials helps to prevent
publication bias – meaning that negative results are likely to never be
 published. Clinical trial registries make it unlikely that you will be
“scooped”, as you know about the other studies addressing the same
questions years before they finish.</p>
