  <title>Problem</title>
  <p>You want to distribute papers for a regular journal club in your
  department.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="solution">
  <title>Solution</title>
  <p>Create a group for your journal club in
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174148/http://www.friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</ext-link>.
  You can create a either a private group, where only group member can
  read and post messages, or a public group that is open to everyone.
  Then invite all regular participants of your journal club to
  <italic><italic>FriendFeed</italic></italic> and make them join the
  group.</p>
  <p>Announce the papers that you want to discuss in the journal club
  via a <italic><italic>FriendFeed</italic></italic> message. For this
  go to the webpage for the paper you want to discuss (e.g.
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174148/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7256/full/nature08237.html">this
  paper</ext-link>) and then use the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174148/http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet">FriendFeed
  bookmarklet</ext-link> to announce the paper (and additional
  information such as the date of the journal club) in the
  <italic><italic>FriendFeed</italic></italic> group. If the copyright
  of the paper allows this, you could also post the fulltext PDF of the
  paper to the <italic><italic>FriendFeed</italic></italic> group.</p>
  <p>Use <italic><italic>FriendFeed</italic></italic> comments to
  capture the discussion about the paper in the journal club. The
  comments can also contain links to other relevant papers and the
  slides you may have prepaped for the journal club. This is helpful for
  those unable to attend the journal club in person, or to look back at
  the journal club a few months later.</p>

  (and probably some other tools) offer similar functionality, so use
  the service you are most comfortable with. Of the tools mentioned,
  <italic><italic>FriendFeed</italic></italic> for me is the easiest to
  set up and use.</p>

  <title>Discussion</title>
  <p>Email is not a good solution for regularly sending around large
  files. And discussions among a larger group of people (i.e. all
  members of a journal club) are difficult to follow via email.
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174148/http://wave.google.com/">Google
  Wave</ext-link> is a good alternative without these limitations, but
  is not yet publicly available.</p>
  <p>A
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174148/http://openwetware.org/wiki/Journal_Club">Wiki</ext-link>
  or
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150922174148/http://blogs.nature.com/nature/journalclub/">blog</ext-link>
  could also be used to organize a journal club, but requires a larger
  effort to set up and maintain.</p>
  <p>Many reference managers allow their users to create private groups
  for sharing references. But in order to work as a tool for a journal
  club, we also need messages/comments. Not only to discuss the paper,
  but simply to provide the date and presenter for the journal club or
  other organisational information. But I wouldn't be surprised if more
  reference managers besides <italic><italic>CiteULike</italic></italic>
  add these features in the future.</p>
  <p>If all journal club papers should automatically be stored in a
  reference manager, use either
  <italic><italic>CiteULike</italic></italic> or put the papers for the
  journal club first into the reference manager and then export them via
  RSS feed into <italic><italic>FriendFeed</italic></italic>. This step
  can be automated if you create a group/folder for the journal club in
  your reference manager.</p>
