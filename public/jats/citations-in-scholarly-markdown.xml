<p>In the comments on
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/17/what-is-scholarly-markdown/">Monday’s
blog post</ext-link> about the Markdown for Science workshop,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carlboettiger.info/">Carl
Boettiger</ext-link> had some good arguments against the proposal for
how to do
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/citations">citations</ext-link>
that we came up with during the workshop. As this is a complex topic, I
decided to write this blog post.</p>
<p>Citations of the scholarly literature are an essential part of
scholarly texts and therefore have to be supported by scholarly
markdown. Both the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html">Pandoc</ext-link>
and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/wiki/MultiMarkdown-Syntax-Guide">Multimarkdown</ext-link>
flavors of markdown support citations, using a bibtex file that contains
citations, placeholders for citekeys – <monospace>[@smith04]</monospace>
for Pandoc and <monospace>[#smith04]</monospace> for Multimarkdown – and
the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://citationstyles.org/">Citation
Style Language</ext-link> for citation formatting (Pandoc). A very
reasonable approach would therefore be to use this functionality, with a
preference for Pandoc because of the Citation Style Language support.
All reference managers can export to the bibtex format, and some of them
(e.g.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.papersapp.com/papers/">Papers</ext-link>)
make it very easy to copy and paste citekeys.</p>
<p>Ten days after the workshop I’m not so sure anymore this is the best
approach. For four reasons:</p>
<list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
    <p><bold><bold>YFNS</bold></bold>. This approach failed the YFNS
    (your friendly neighborhood scientist) test. We came up with this
    term during the workshop and it means that our ideas about authoring
    should make sense to the workflow of the average scientist. I
    thought that using citekeys is a good idea, but my wife (my YFNS)
    tells me that she never uses citekeys because there are just too
    many <monospace>[@smith04]</monospace>, and it is too easy get out
    of sync with the reference manager. She therefore prefers to put the
    complete reference information into the text while writing.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><bold><bold>Snippets</bold></bold>. As I said
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/17/what-is-scholarly-markdown/">previously</ext-link>,
    I think that scholarly markdown has great potential not so much for
    writing full papers, but for all the little scientific documents we
    write on a daily basis. For this reason the citation information
    should ideally be embedded in the document if it is short, and that
    is difficult with bibtex (which is not human-readable).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><bold><bold>Citations as links</bold></bold>. Carl Boettiger
    reminded me that I wrote a
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/12/11/citations-are-links-so-where-is-the-problem/">blog
    post in 2010</ext-link> stating that citations are nothing else than
    links, and that we should treat them accordingly. He has written a
    tool
    (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carlboettiger.info/2012/05/30/knitcitations.html">knitcitations</ext-link>)
    for R that does just that, and Phil Lord and colleagues have written
    a similar tool
    (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/kcite/">kcite</ext-link>)
    for Wordpress. In 2010 I wrote a tool for Wordpress
    (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/link-to-link/">Link
    to Link</ext-link>) that takes a different approach but also treats
    citations as links. All that we need is the DOI (or URL) for the
    article.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><bold><bold>Vendor lock-in</bold></bold>. Although a number of
    excellent reference managers are available now, users are still
    limited in their choices because everyone has to use the same
    reference manager when multiple authors work on the same document.
    This has always annoyed me. It would no longer be the case if we
    embed the citation information in the document in a standard
    format.</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>Part of the motivation for using scholarly markdown is that we can
come up with best practices that make sense for digital content and
don’t need to support conventions from an era when articles were still
printed on paper. Reference information in the form of volumes and
pages, and 1000s of citation styles certainly have outlived their
purpose. Citation styles are a particular pain point, as they are
nothing more than a visual representation of a citation - we should care
much more about the machine-readable metadata, in particular the DOI or
other identifier.</p>
<p>The best practice for scholarly markdown could therefore be to treat
citations as links, using DOIs or other standard identifiers (PMID,
ArXiV, etc.) where possible. Because we typically want to list the
citations as references at the end of the document, reference-style
links should be preferred over inline links. From the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link">markdown
syntax documentation</ext-link>:</p>
<preformat>This is [an example][id] reference-style link.

This is [an example](http://example.com/ &quot;Title&quot;) inline link.
[id]: http://example.com/  &quot;Optional Title Here&quot;</preformat>
<p>It might be tempting to use sequential numbers as id for the
reference-style links, but the order of links can of course change
during writing. It may make sense to think of the id in reference-style
links as a citekey, and people should be free use that functionality of
their reference manager. The citekey is used to link to the reference
list at the bottom of the document, different from linking to the
citekey in a separate bibtex file.</p>
<p>All of the above can be done in any text editor. This also includes
the text editor that scholars spend most of their time with - their
email program. Reference-style citations in an email are very readable,
and also actionable since they are links and not text with bibliographic
information.</p>
<p>One problem with this approach is of course that all links are inline
in the resulting HTML, without a references section at the end of the
document. This may be fine, as we can provide citation information in
the title attribute, available upon hovering over the link (try hovering
over
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">this
link</ext-link>, the journal eLife is doing
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00633">something
similar</ext-link>). The markdown could look like this (using the
<italic>Vancouver</italic> citation style):</p>
<preformat>[@Ioannidis2005]: http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124 &quot;Ioannidis JPA. Why Most Published Research Findings Are False. PLoS Medicine. Public Library of Science; 2005;2(8):e124. Available from: http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124&quot;</preformat>
<p>The title attribute now of course uses a citation style, but this is
optional information and can easily be reformatted as we have the
DOI.</p>
<p>Or we break away from standard markdown and display reference-style
links at the end of the document - similar to
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rephrase.net/box/word/footnotes/syntax/">footnotes</ext-link>,
which are also not part of standard markdown. But this is just a display
issue that can be solved, and the solution might look different
depending on whether the output is HTML, PDF or XML. This document for
example contains 14 reference-style citations.</p>
<p>There is obviously a need for tools that make adding citations to
scholarly markdown easier. This could be accomplished by relatively
small changes to existing reference managers (enabling copy/paste of
citations in reference-style markdown format), or by tools similar to
the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carlboettiger.info/2012/05/30/knitcitations.html">knitcitations</ext-link>
and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/kcite/">kcite</ext-link>
mentioned above.</p>
