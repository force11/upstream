a report on the prevalence of duplicate papers in Medline. In this
report Mounir Errami and Harold Garner estimate that there as many as
200.000 duplicate papers in Medline or 1% of all published papers.</p>
<p>The article has already been widely cited, including of course

They used the search engine eTBLAST to find duplicate papers and
deposited the results in a database called
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://spore.swmed.edu/dejavu/">Deja
Vu</ext-link>. When you search Deja Vu for scientists you know, you find
scary results.</p>
<p>Nobody likes duplicate papers, but it's just another trick to improve
your publication record. Another popular trick is the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v8/n11/full/7401095.html">inflation</ext-link>
of paper authors. But the basic trick is still the heavy use of the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092517/http://chronicle.com/jobs/2004/02/2004020901c.htm">least
publishable unit</ext-link> or LPU.</p>
<p>Both authors and journals are inclined to publish as many papers as
possible. So what will change these practices? If the quality of the
work of a scientist isn't simply measured by numerical indices such as
number of publications. So it's up to those that decide about grants and
jobs to find a better way to pick up the best scientists.</p>
