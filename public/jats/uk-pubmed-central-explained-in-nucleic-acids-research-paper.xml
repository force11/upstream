<p>Last Tuesday <italic><italic>Nucleic Acids Research</italic></italic>
published a nice paper describing the

PubMed Central</ext-link> (UKPMC) database (McEntyre 2010). UKPMC was
started in 2007, the enhanced version described in the paper was
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://blogit.realwire.com/?ReleaseID=14754">launched

<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blog.martinfenner.org//uk_pubmed_central_interview_with_phil_vaughan/">interview
with Phil Vaughan</ext-link>, the senior author of the paper. The paper
talks about the specific enhancements done to PubMed Central, including
an integrated search of PubMed and PubMed Central, “Cited by
information” and semantically enriched content generated by text
mining.</p>

<p>Thanks to Duncan Hull we know that PubMed currently contains
information about 20 million papers
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://duncan.hull.name/2010/07/27/pubmed-20-million/">Twenty
million papers in PubMed: a triumph or a tragedy?</ext-link>). About 10%
of these papers are available as fulltext from PubMed Central. What
wasn’t clear to me and what I learned from the paper is that only
194,000 papers, or 1% of PubMed content, are from the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/openftlist.html">PMC
Open Access Subset</ext-link> (and that includes papers with a
non-commercial OA license). All these papers are available as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185412/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/ftp.html">download</ext-link>
or via

service</ext-link>. Although 1.8 million papers (the majority digitized
back issues) can be freely downloaded as full-text from PubMed Central,
they carry a publisher copyright and can’t be reused for research
purposes (e.g. full-text mining) without an explicit permission from the
publisher.</p>
