<p>One of the opening lectures this Saturday of the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091608/http://www.geneticsberlin2008.com/">International
Congress of Genetics</ext-link> was held by
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611091608/http://capecchi.genetics.utah.edu/">Mario
Capecchi</ext-link>. His talked was entitled <italic><italic>Modeling
human disease in the mouse: from cancer to neuropsychiatric
disorders</italic></italic>. In the first half he described his mouse
model of synovial sarcoma. Synovial sarcoma is an aggressive and often
fatal soft tissue tumor. The pathogenesis of the disease is poorly
understood, but synovial sarcoma is characterized by a t(X;18)
translocation that creates a fusion of the SYT and SSX (SSX1, SX2 or
SSX4) genes.</p>
<p>Early and ubiquitous expression of a SYT-SSX transgene is lethal in
the mouse embryo, so Mario Capecchi's group created a mouse that
expresses the fusion gene only at specific timepoints and only in
skeletal muscle. Practically all mice develop tumors that resemble
synovial sarcoma in human. This mouse model provides an attractive
preclinical platform for new treatment strategies. Those interested in
the full story can read the Cancer Cell paper (Haldar 2007) that was
published last year.</p>
<p>Everybody has a different reason to be interested in research. It can
be the curiousity to better understand a fundamental process, It can be
the wish to create a business opportunity. It can be the determination
to do something about climate change or poverty. Or it can be the desire
to better help a patient with a disease that is difficult or impossible
to treat. I trained as a medical doctor and currently spend most of my
time treating patients with cancer. Just last week I was seeing a young
patient with synovial sarcoma and lung metastasis. Understanding the
biology of cancer is essential to find better treatment strategies and
we have witnessed many

examples</ext-link> for this.</p>
<p>This so-called translational research is unfortunately a wonderful
concept that more often than not doesn't work in practice. Basic science
often is poorly connected to clinical medicine, both on a personal and
institutional level. But change is apparently underway, if you believe
