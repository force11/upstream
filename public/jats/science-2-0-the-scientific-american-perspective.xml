<p>M. Mitchell Waldrop has posted a draft version of an article called
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092539/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=science-2-point-0-great-new-tool-or-great-risk">Science
2.0: Great New Tool, or Great Risk?</ext-link>. The article will appear
in
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092539/http://www.sciam.com/">Scientific
American</ext-link> (which, like the Nature Publishing Group, is owned
by Macmillan). In this article he talks about the increasing use of Web
2.0 technologies in research. The largest part of the article is about
Open Notebook Science and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092539/http://openwetware.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenWetWare</ext-link>
in particular. But he also talks about science blogs and other Web 2.0
efforts such as Nature Network, which is mentioned briefly at the end of
the article.</p>
<p>The draft article was posted online last week. In true Web 2.0
spirit, M. Mitchell Waldrop has invited readers to post comments and
promised that he will use them for the final print version. I wrote a
comment and suggested that the increasing role of Web 2.0 companies such
as Google, Microsoft and Adobe in the online creation and distribution
of science should be mentioned in the article.</p>
