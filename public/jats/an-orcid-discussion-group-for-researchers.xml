<p>The Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID</ext-link>)
initiative is working on a unique researcher identifier for the creation
of a clear and unambiguous scholarly record. The initiative is supported
by
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://www.orcid.org/directory">more
than 140</ext-link> universities, research institutes, funding
organizations, publishers and other organizations interested in
scholarly communication. The ORCID system will become publicly available
in the first half of 2011.</p>
<p>Individual researchers will benefit from a unique researcher
identifier because this identifier facilitates the manuscript submission
process, and the creation of CVs and publication lists for institutional
websites. Unique researcher identifiers will also help discover
scholarly works and will make it easier to attribute scientific
contributions other than papers –  e.g. research datasets – to
individual researchers.</p>
<p>Researchers have a lot to gain from unique researcher identifiers,
and they might also have genuine concerns. Because of my interest in
scholarly communication, and

researcher identifiers in particular</ext-link>, I became involved with
the ORCID initiative in early 2010. When ORCID became a non-profit
organization in August, I was asked to sit on the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://www.orcid.org/board-directors">Board
of Directors</ext-link> – one of many interesting things that have
happened to me as the result of my science blogging. But although ORCID
is certainly open to all individuals and organizations interested in
author disambiguation, most researchers simply want to be informed about
the progress of the initiative, ask specific questions and start using
their identifier at some point.</p>
<p>The
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191013/http://www.orcid.org/">ORCID
website</ext-link> is a good starting for this information, but to get
individual answers to specific researcher questions about ORCID,
