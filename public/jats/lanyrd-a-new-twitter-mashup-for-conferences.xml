is a new social directory for conferences launched just a few days ago.
It integrates with Twitter to allow you to list conferences you are
organizing, speaking at, attending, or just following. It is a social
directory in the sense that everyone can edit this information (I don’t
know who started the

conferences of your Twitter contacts. Future versions of Lanyrd will do
a lot more (you can see some of the upcoming features at the

Lanyrd is a joint project by web developers and newly-weds Simon
Willison and Natalie Downe. They launched Lanyrd from Morocco while on
an extended honeymoon and don’t plan to be back to England before the
end of next year.</p>
<p>Sites such as <bold><bold>Eventbrite</bold></bold>,
<bold><bold>Upcoming</bold></bold> or
<bold><bold>Slideshare</bold></bold> have been around for a while.
Twitter is becoming an increasingly useful tool for conferences

Great Science Online London Tweetup</ext-link>). And Lanyrd is one of
