Metrics</ext-link> provide new ways to look at the impact of scholarly
research. Two important concepts are a) to track metrics for individual
scholarly articles instead of using numbers aggregated by journal, and
b) to go beyond citations and also include usage stats and
altmetrics.</p>
<p>Article-Level Metrics is also doing something else: instead of
tracking impact by year, it looks at usage, altmetrics and citations in
real-time. There might have been technical reasons to do so 20 years
ago, but there really is no longer any reason why scholarly impact
should be tracked on a yearly basis in 2013. Unfortunately there is one
big stumbling block:</p>

  <disp-quote>
    <p><italic><italic>The publication date of a scholarly article is
    often difficult or impossible to obtain. Publication year may be the
    only available information.</italic></italic></p>
  </disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A good example is CrossRef. They provide a lot of interesting
metadata about an article and make this information available in
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102027/http://search.crossref.org/">a
very nice search interface</ext-link>. But they only require the
publisher to provide the publication year, information about the
publication month and day is optional. There are many other examples of
journals and services that just can’t tell you when exactly an article
was published. This might have made sense when periodicals were printed
on paper, but doesn’t work for digital content.</p>
