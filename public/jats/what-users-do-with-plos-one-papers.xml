<p>Inspired by four recent blog posts and their comments

you email it, they will comment</ext-link>), I created a graphic to show
what users do with PLoS ONE papers. As always, the data behind the
graphic are
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423155530/http://www.plosone.org/static/almInfo.action">openly
available</ext-link>. I think that the number of times a paper is
informally discussed (comments, Facebook, science blogs, etc.) should be
much larger compared to the numer of formal citations. The challenge is
of course to have technology that captures all these discussions â€“ this
is much more difficult than for bookmarks or citations, and is obviously
what
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423155530/http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">altmetrics</ext-link>
is all about. The blog posts I link to above also express another
feeling: that there are still too many barriers for scientists to take
part in the informal discussion of scholarly research on the web, in
particular as comments on journal websites. Hat tip to
