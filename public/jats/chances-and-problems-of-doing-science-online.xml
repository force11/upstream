Museion in Copenhagen</ext-link> reminded me that there are limitations
of what can be done online. My blog focusses on talking about science
rather than doing science, but this post is about doing science online.
My research focusses on clinical cancer research, and in this field the
advantages and limitations of doing science online are obviously
different from other subject areas (bioinformatics for example obviously
looks very different). It probably makes sense to ask yourself the
following questions:</p>

  <p>Electronic medical records

  patient care and reduce costs</ext-link>. But for now, often only some
  clinical information (particularly lab and radiology results) is
  available electronically and paper-based patient records are still
  commonly used. And both electronic and paper-based records have to be
  adapted to be useful for clinical research, e.g. by allowing a
  detailed documentation of adverse events.</p>
  <p>The raw clinical data of a patient in a trial (called
  <italic><italic>source data</italic></italic> in clinical research)
  are entered into a case-report form
  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report_form">CRF</ext-link>).
  The purpose of this two-step process is to make sure that all required
  data are collected and that they are entered correctly. Many clinical
  trials now use electronic CRFs or electronic data capture (EDC). But
  these tools are still surprisingly difficult to use and more expensive
  than paper-based solutions, so that many trials stick to paper CRFs
  and enter the data into a computer at a later stage. It also doesn't
  help that the EDC market is very fragmented, so that institutions have
  to learn to use several different tools.</p>

  <title>Do you regularly collaborate with scientists in other
  locations?</title>
  <p>Most clinical trials are multi-center trials that are conducted in
  different locations, often even in different countries or continents.
  The coordination of the different trial locations uses email and web
  conferencing, but often relies more on human resources than on modern
  Web 2.0 tools.</p>

  <title>Is information about ongoing research projects publicly

  <p>Clinical research is one of only a few research areas where
  information about (almost) all ongoing research project is publicly
  available. Clinical trial registries serve two purposes. They make it
  much easier for patients and their treating physicians to find
  relevant clinical trials. And they allow clinical researchers to
  understand what clinical research is going on in their field, and to
  avoid publication bias.

  <p>An article in the <italic><italic>BMJ</italic></italic> last month
  by Iain Hrynaszkiewicz and
  colleagues<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/03/15/chances_and_problems_of_doing_science_online/#fn1">1</ext-link></sup>
  tries to provide guidance on how to provide raw clinical data for
  publication. The main focus of the paper is patient privacy.
  Publication of raw clinical data either as dataset or as part of a
  research paper is still very uncommon. The meta-analysis of individual
  patient
  data<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/03/15/chances_and_problems_of_doing_science_online/#fn2">2</ext-link></sup>
  requires the raw clinical data of several clinical trials, and because
  of the required effort is probably underused.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="are-there-objections-to-make-the-research-data-freely-available">
  <title>Are there objections to make the research data freely

  <p>Patient privacy is a major concern when publishing raw clinical
  data, and it's therefore critical to remove all identifying
  information from the dataset. This not only includes
  <italic><italic>direct identifiers</italic></italic> such as patient
  names, birthdates, unique identifying numbers or facial photographs,
  but also <italic><italic>indirect identifers</italic></italic> such as
  place of treatment, rare disease or treatment, occupation or place of
  work, etc. It is the consensus of the authors of the
  <italic><italic>BMJ</italic></italic> paper that datasets with three
  or more indirect identifiers should be evaluated for the risk that
  individuals might be identifiable before they are made available,</p>
  <p>In contrast to
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/">Open
  Notebook Science</ext-link>, it is impossible to make the results of a
  clinical trial publicly available before the trial is completed. The
  statistical design of the clinical trial is based on the number of
  patients needed to show a significant difference โ looking at interim
  data could influence patient recruitment. Double-blind designs (where
  neither patient nor treating physician now which treatment arm the
  patient is in) are based on the same principle.</p>
  <p>In clinical research there is often more at stake than the
  well-being of patients and the careers of the scientists involved.

  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>Online tools can help with doing clinical research and there is
  probably a lot of untapped potential. From the perspective of an
  individual researcher or a small research group, it probably makes the
  most sense to develop and/or use tools that solve specific problems. I
  use the online project management tool
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</ext-link>
  to coordinate one clinical research project. And I have created a
  web-based
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611095611/http://www.mh-hannover.de/studien/">clinical
  trials registry</ext-link> for our university hospital. The internet
  version of this registry helps patients and referring physicians to
  find clinical trials at our institution. The intranet version helps us
  manage our clinical trials, e.g. by keeping all required documents in
  one place, keeping track of the patients registered in clinical
  trials, and serious adverse event reporting. And I don't see why
  clinical researchers can't adopt the

  Principles</ext-link> โ which endorse that data related to published
  science should be explicitly placed in the public domain โ whenever
