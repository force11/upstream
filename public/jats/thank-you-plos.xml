<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.datacite.org/news/martin-fenner-and-laura-rueda-join-datacite-team.html">Starting
next week</ext-link> I will work as the DataCite Technical Director, and
I am excited about this new opportunity. But this is material for
another post, here I want to reflect on the last three years working as
Technical Lead for the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lagotto.io/plos/">PLOS
Article-Level Metrics</ext-link> project.</p>
<p>It feels much longer than three years, but until May 2012 I worked as
medical oncologist at Hannover Medical School, treating patient with
cancer, attending interdisciplinary tumor boards and helping with
clinical trials. It was a very brave move by PLOS to hire me at this
point, especially since I
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/why-work-where-we-live/">worked
remotely</ext-link> from Germany rather than in the San Francisco
office. I will be forever thankful to PLOS for giving me this
opportunity.</p>
<p>Two factors probably played a role in this decision: I have been
blogging about how the internet is changing scholarly communication
since 2007, and since September 2010 I had
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/">my
blog on the PLOS Blogs Network</ext-link>. I had also visited the PLOS
offices in San Francisco, and had met several PLOS people at
conferences, including Pete Binfield, Rich Cave, Mark Patterson, Brian
Mossop, Jennifer Lin and Liz Allen. I had
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2009/08/15/plos_one_interview_with_peter_binfield/">interviewed</ext-link>
Pete Binfield about PLOS ONE and the PLOS Article-Level Metrics project
in August 2009, shortly after the project was launched.</p>
<p>The other factor was the hackathon at the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/science-online-london-2011/">2011
Science Online London</ext-link> conference. We were a really small
group of people (I remember Jason Hoyt, Victor Henning, Kristi Holmes
and Cameron Neylon, Mendeley was hosting the event), but I had the idea
to hack the open source PLOS Article-Level Metrics application. This
hack turned into
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/posts/announcing-sciencecard/">ScienceCard</ext-link>,
a version of the PLOS Article-Level Metrics application focussing on
people rather than articles, and the application was a finalist for the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blog.mendeley.com/highlighting-research/the-top-101-apps-in-the-mendeley-plos-binary-battle/">Mendeley/PLOS
API Binary Battle</ext-link>. ScienceCard doesn’t exist anymore, but the
concept of organizing metrics around a person lives on in ImpactStory
(see my profile
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://impactstory.org/mfenner">here</ext-link>),
facilitated by the launch of ORCID in October 2012. More importantly -
without me knowing it - ScienceCard demonstrated that I could work with
and extend the PLOS Article-Level Metrics code, and I think I was the
first person outside of PLOS doing this. Which must have helped when
PLOS was looking for a technical lead for the project a few months
later.</p>
<p>In other words, blogging and hacking code can lead to great job
opportunities.</p>
<p>While at PLOS I not only learned a ton of things about article-level
metrics and all its challenges and opportunities, but also many basic
skills needed in software development. Which is important, as my formal
training is in clinical medicine and molecular biology, and doing
software development in your free time (which I had done since the
1990s) only gets you so far. Some of the unexpected things I
learned:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p><bold><bold>Visualizations</bold></bold>: while it was clear that
    I was expected to generate visualizations for the PLOS Article-Level
    Metrics data, I didn’t expect this to go so deep, first with R and
    later with
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</ext-link>.
    Najko Jahn introduced me to using R to analyze the PLOS data, and I
    later worked closely with Scott Chamberlain from the
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</ext-link>
    project to help improve their
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ropensci.org/tutorials/alm_tutorial.html">alm
    package</ext-link>. The Javascript work with d3.js started with
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/alm-workshop-2012/hackathon/#altviz">AlmViz</ext-link>
    at the 2012 ALM hackathon and later was done in close collaboration
    with Juan Alperin from the
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/">Public
    Knowledge Project</ext-link>.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><bold><bold>DevOps</bold></bold>: the intersection of software
    development and system administration. I became a big fan and have
    spent endless hours learning how to automate the configuration and
    deployment of servers and other infrastructure.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><bold>O<bold>pen source community building</bold></bold>: again
    something I was expected to do around the PLOS article-level metrics
    open source application, but I never expected this to be so
    challenging and time-consuming, but also rewarding.</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>I thank everyone at PLOS who I had the pleasure to work with over the
years, in particular Kristen Ratan, Cameron Neylon, Donna Okubo, Mei Yan
Leung, Liz Allen, Catriona MacCallum, Matt Hodgkinson, Theo Bloom,
Damian Pattinson, Ginny Barbour, Emma Ganley, Roli Roberts, Eric
Martens, Susan Au, Matt Willman, Edgar Munoz, Rachel Drysdale, CJ
Rayhill, Lisa Siegel, Jennifer Song, Polina Grinbaum, John Bertrand,
Mike Baehr, Clark Hartsock, Adam Hyde, and Holly Allen. A very special
thanks goes to Jennifer Lin, Rich Cave and John Chodacki who worked with
me on a daily basis.</p>
