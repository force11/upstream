<p>The
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121333/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsch_number">Hirsch
number</ext-link> tries to quantify the (scientific) productivity of a
scientist. The Hirsch number was first described by the physicist J.E.
Hirsch in a 2005 PNAS paper:
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121333/http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/102/46/16569">An
index to quantify an individualâ€™s scientific research output</ext-link>.
Hirsch says:</p>
<p specific-use="wrapper">
  <disp-quote>
    <p><italic>I propose the index h, defined as the number of papers
    with citation number h, as a useful index to characterize the
    scientific output of a researcher.</italic></p>
  </disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thus, in contrast to the widely used
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121333/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor">impact
factor</ext-link>, the Hirsch number measures the productivity of an
individual scientist and not the journal he publishes in. The Hirsch
number tries to factor in both the number of papers and the number of
citations of these papers.</p>
<p>Your personal Hirsch number should be equal or greater the number of
years you have already spent in science. Again in contrast to the impact
factor, you can calculate your Hirsch number with freely available
tools. You can look up your papers in
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121333/http://scholar.google.com/">Google
Scholar</ext-link> and write down the citations for each paper. Or, use
online tools such as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610121333/http://www-ihm.lri.fr/~roussel/moulinette/h/h.cgi">scHolar
index</ext-link> to do the work for you.</p>
<p>Using a simple number to measure the productivity of scientist is a
dangerous undertaking. But if numbers are needed (e.g. grant or job
applications), the Hirsch number is a good tool. Widespread use of the
Hirsch number could have broad implications, as authors would more
carefully consider which journals would give them the highest number of
citations.</p>
