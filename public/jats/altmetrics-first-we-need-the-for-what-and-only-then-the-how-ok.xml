<p>Altmetrics track the impact of scholarly works in the social web.
Article-Level Metrics focuses on articles, but also looks at traditional
citations and usage statistics. The

Article-Level Metrics</ext-link> project was started in 2008. The
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">altmetrics
manifesto</ext-link> was published in October 2010 and described the
fundamental ideas. By October 2011 we had a number of altmetrics tools,
fueled by the Mendeley/PLOS API
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://blog.mendeley.com/design-research-tools/winners-of-the-first-binary-battle-apps-for-science-contest/">programming
contest</ext-link>. In 2012 the focus shifted from the fact that we can
provide these numbers to a discussion of the many open questions. We
could see this at the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/06/25/random-notes-from-the-altmetrics12-conference/">altmetrics12
conference</ext-link> in June, and even more so at the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/https://sites.google.com/site/altmetricsworkshop/">altmetrics
workshop</ext-link> hosted by PLOS last week in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Altmetrics can provide a large amount of information about the
post-publication activity around an article (and other scholarly
content), and this is exciting, but at the same time also somewhat
overwhelming and scary. Some of the things that we as a community have
to figure out include standards for collecting, aggregating and
displaying altmetrics data, strategies to combat attempts to game these
metrics, and finding appropriate ways for the different organizations
providing altmetrics to work together as a community. These and other
topics were discussed in great detail at the PLOS altmetrics workshop,
and we made excellent progress not least thanks to the excellent
moderation by <italic>Cameron Neylon</italic>. The third day of the
workshop was a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/https://sites.google.com/site/altmetricsworkshop/altmetrics-hackathon">hackathon</ext-link>,
and we were able to translate some of the ideas into prototypes of new
tools.</p>
<p>The most important conclusion from the workshop for me personally was
that we should really should focus on use cases. Altmetrics should help
answer questions that we can’t answer today, and despite the promise,
the various altmetrics tools still have a log way to go. A case in point
is the promise that altmetrics can make it easier to find relevant
scholarly content. We all use social media to help us find papers and
other stuff, but integration of altmetrics into the traditional
scholarly search tools is still missing.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://rerank.it/">ReRank</ext-link>
is a cool prototype developed during the hackathon last Saturday, but we
are still a long way from having altmetrics feeding directly into the
relevance sorting of search results.</p>
<p>With these thoughts in the back of mind, I look forward to the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913082053/http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2012-altmetrics-beyond-the-numbers/">altmetrics
session</ext-link> at the

sans Frontières</ext-link> (MSF) will talk about the questions that she
hopes altmetrics can answer for her organization. MSF is very interested
to look beyond citations for the impact of their publications, as their
primary target audience is not really the scholarly community, but
rather people in need in various parts of the world. <italic>Marie

Article-Level Metrics project</ext-link>) will use our respective tools
to try to answer some of these questions. For me altmetrics are
primarily tools to tell a good story, and that is one reason why we
picked the title <italic>Altmetrics beyond the Numbers</italic> for this
session. The focus of the session will then shift to an open discussion,
and I hope we can get some good answers to this and other questions.</p>
<p>A clear focus on use cases should go a long way to reduce that
feeling of being overwhelmed by all the numbers that altmetrics can
provide. If we have specific goals for which we need altmetrics, it
becomes much easier to decide what numbers work best for us, what
standards we need and whom to ask to collect this information.
