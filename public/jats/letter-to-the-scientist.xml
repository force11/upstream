<p>Dear Scientist,</p>
<p>last week you published an interesting article by
<bold><bold>Christian Specht</bold></bold> about
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525054056/http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/57689/">Mutations
of citations</ext-link>. Dr. Specht found more than 600 wrong citations
for the paper by Laemmli (Laemmli 1970), which has been cited at least
88633 times according to Scopus.</p>
<p><bold><bold>Laemmli UK</bold></bold>. Cleavage of Structural Proteins
during the Assembly of the Head of Bacteriophage T4.
<italic><italic>Nature</italic></italic>. 1970;227:680-685.
https://doi.org/<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525054056/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/227680a0">10.1038/227680a0</ext-link></p>
<p>I was intrigued by the “sequence alignment” in Fig. 1a which clearly
demonstrated that point mutations at 2<bold><bold>2</bold></bold>7 and
68<bold><bold>0</bold></bold> are particularly common, and that some
mutations are inherited between overlapping groups of scientists. Of
particular interest is the “complete nonsense mutation” that attributes
the citation to the journal
<italic><italic>Science</italic></italic>.</p>
<p>However, the author failed to demonstrate that the citation mutations
had a paper-not-found phenotype or whether they were simply silent
mutations. Missing is also an analysis of whether the mutations</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p>originated with the paper authors (who by now should all be using
    reference managers that automatically import citations),</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>were introduced by the publisher during manuscript production
    (many journals use tools such as
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120525054056/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/05/01/extyles-interview-with-elizabeth-blake-and-bruce-rosenblum">eXtyles</ext-link>
    to check and fix citations in manuscripts), or</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>first appeared in the scientific databases that stored the
    citations (Specht used Web of Science).</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>Of particular interest would be whether there is a decrease in
mutation rate over time, as automated tools have increased the fidelity
of the citation process, and whether any citation style was particularly
prone to mutations (no citation style uses checksums). As a researcher I
suggest that the burden of proofreading should rest not with paper
authors, and that journal and database publishers invest in appropriate
citation repair mechanisms. And please use the DOI, even the paper by
Laemmli (Laemmli 1970) has one.</p>
