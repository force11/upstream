<p>On Saturday June 8th – exactly a month from today – the PLOS San
Francisco offices will host a workshop/hackathon about using markdown
for science. A lot of people are experimenting with markdown for
authoring scientific articles – see blog posts

and the scientific manuscript

<p>Markdown is a simple markup language for text, and is primarily used
for HTML content on the web, but can also be converted to PDF, LaTeX and
others. One challenge with markdown is that there are a number of
slightly different “flavors” out there, from the original markdown to
multimarkdown, github-flavored markdown and pandoc. Some of the advanced
formatting of scientific documents – tables, citations, math – is still
a challenge for markdown.</p>
<p>Will markdown become our next authoring format for scientific
content? Will there be yet another flavor, scholarly markdown? How will
markdown writing tools be different from LaTeX tools or Microsoft Word?
If you care about any of these questions and are in or near San
Francisco, join us on for all full day on June 8th. Free registration is
open at
