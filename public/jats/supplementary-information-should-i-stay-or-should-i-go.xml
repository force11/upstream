<p>The main arguments against supplementary information are that it
overburdens reviewers (and in turn authors), and it counteracts the
concept of a self-contained research report. The main argument for
supplementary information is that sometimes essential information can’t
be provided within the context of a journal article (e.g. video, large
datasets), especially in those journals that still have print editions.
Several blog posts emphasized that supplementary information is
particularly important to provide the research data with the article. I
think that Heather Piwowar’s
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/08/13/supplementary-materials-is-a-stopgap-for-data-archiving/">post</ext-link>
is the best discussion of the relevant issues.</p>
<p>I’m obviously two weeks late with this blog posts, but I have been on
vacation, and I’m only slowly catching up with all the interesting
discussions that have happened while I was away. I think the discussion
of supplementary information is very important, because it really is a
discussion of our concept of a scientific paper. And this concept is
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2009/07/26/how-does-the-article-of-the-future-look-like">changing
rapidly</ext-link> for many reasons, including the push to mobile
platforms, and the wish by many to publish multimedia files (e.g. 3D
structures) and research data with a paper.</p>
<p><italic>Phil Bourne: Beyond the PDF.</italic></p>
<p>It appears to me that we haven’t talked much about supplementary
information, and it really has been something everybody was doing out of
necessity, without too much thinking about many of the issues, including
standard formats, problems for users finding and storing this
supplementary information, and copyright issues.</p>
<p>Most journals have (often similar) instructions regarding
supplementary information, e.g.:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">

    <p><italic>Supplementary Information is peer-reviewed material
    directly relevant to the conclusion of a paper that cannot be
    included in the printed version for reasons of space or medium.

<p>The announcement of the <italic><italic>Journal of
Neuroscience</italic></italic> will hopefully initiate a broader
discussion of the usefulness and best format of supplementary
information. The most interesting aspect for me and several of the
bloggers discussing the announcement is the publication of the research
data associated with a paper. For now supplementary information is often
the only place these data can be published, but there are
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524201522/http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/08/13/supplementary-materials-is-a-stopgap-for-data-archiving/">many
reasons</ext-link> why this is not the best idea in the long run.</p>

track blog posts relating to an article. We have
