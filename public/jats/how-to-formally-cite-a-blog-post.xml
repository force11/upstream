<p>Other blog posts often provide important background material for your
own posts, and they are typically cited by
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">inline
links</ext-link> in the text. But sometimes we need more formal
citations, e.g. when citing blog posts in a journal article or when
providing a bibliography. But how do you properly cite a blog post?</p>

Style</ext-link> – from the Publication Manual of the American
Psychological Association – suggests the following format:</p>
<p><bold>Fenner, M.H.</bold> (2011, January 23). Beyond the PDF … is
ePub [Web log post]. Retrieved from
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-…-is-epub/</ext-link></p>
<p>This is a good start, but I think the citation should include the
name of the blog. The
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html">Chicago
Manual of Style</ext-link> does this:</p>
<p><bold>Fenner, M.H.,</bold> “Beyond the PDF … is ePub,” Gobbledygook,

<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-…-is-epub/</ext-link></p>

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-…-is-epub/</ext-link></p>
<p>This is a little bit too much for me. There is an argument to use the
accession date for web content, but having two dates can be confusing
and the publication date is more important. I personally prefer a
citation format that looks very similar to a journal article citation
(and comes closest to the Chicago Manual of Style):</p>
<p><bold>Fenner, M.H.</bold> Beyond the PDF … is ePub.
<italic>Gobbledygook</italic>, January 23, 2011.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-…-is-epub/</ext-link></p>
<p>If we want to include blog posts in a reference list, we also have to
think about the formatting. In <bold>BibTeX</bold>a blog entry would
look like this:</p>
<p>@misc{ author = {Fenner, Martin}, title = {Beyond the PDF … is ePub},
journal = {Gobbledygook}, type = {Blog}, number = {January 23}, year =
{2011}, howpublished =
{\url{http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-…-is-epub/}}</p>
<p><bold>BibTeX</bold> doesn’t have an entry type for blog posts, so we
have to use @misc and use the type field. @unpublished is an
alternative, but that is a strange name. We have to put the URL into the
howpublished field, which is also awkward.</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://www.refman.com/support/risformat_intro.asp">RIS</ext-link>
is another popular format, and knows about blogs and URLs:</p>
<p>TY  - BLOG AU  - Fenner, Martin TI  - Beyond the PDF … is ePub JF  -
Gobbledygook PY  - 2011/01/23 UR  -
http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-…-is-epub/ ER
 -</p>
<p><bold>BibTeX</bold> and <bold>RIS</bold> both predate the web. A
modern reference format should use HTML or XML so that it can be
embedded directly in the blog post. The recently announced
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/06/07/schema-org-for-scholarly-html/">Schema.org</ext-link>
micro data format is a strong candidate for this
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://scholarlyhtml.org/">Scholarly
HTML</ext-link>, and it has a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://schema.org/BlogPosting">BlogPosting</ext-link>
format:</p>
<p>&lt;div itemscope
itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/BlogPosting&quot;&gt; &lt;span
itemprop=&quot;author&quot; itemscope
itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/Person&quot;&gt; &lt;span
itemprop=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Fenner, Martin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span itemprop=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Beyond the PDF … is
ePub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span
itemprop=&quot;publisher&quot;&gt;Gobbledygook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;time
datetime=&quot;2011-01-23&quot;&gt;01/23/11&lt;/time&gt; &lt;a
href=&quot;http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-…-is-epub/&quot;
itemprop=&quot;url&quot;&gt;http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-…-is-epub/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>There are other ways to describe this blog post with
<bold>Schema.org</bold>, but the best practices are still evolving. How
this BlogPosting above looks in a blog obviously depends on the CSS
styling used, without any styling it looks like this:</p>
<p>Fenner, Martin
Beyond the PDF … is ePub
Gobbledygook
01/23/11
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913072431/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-%E2%80%A6-is-epub/">http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/23/beyond-the-pdf-…-is-epub/</ext-link></p>
<p>With a little work on the CSS for this blog, the citation could look
exactly as shown above, but with added semantic information that is
understood by search engines and other tools. It is clear to me that
HTML-based standards such as Schema.org are the future for embedding
citation information in blog posts. We need better tools to make this
process as painless as possible.</p>
