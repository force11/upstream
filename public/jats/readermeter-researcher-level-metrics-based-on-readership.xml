post last week</ext-link>, Dario Taraborelli officially announced
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://readermeter.org/">ReaderMeter</ext-link>.
ReaderMeter takes the usage data from reference managers (starting with
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</ext-link>)
to analyze the impact of publications by a particular author.</p>
<p>ReaderMeter is a welcome addition to other metrics of researcher
impact, most of which are citation-based. And ReaderMeter was hacked
together in a few nights, so the service should improve over time. Dario
mentions some of the current limitations in his blog post:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p><bold><bold>Usage data only from Mendeley</bold></bold>. We don’t
    know whether the reading patterns of users from other reference
    managers (e.g. CiteULike, Zotero, Endnote Web and Refworks) differ.
    Dario is working on adding more services.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><bold><bold>Author disambiguation</bold></bold>. This is a
    critical component, and the
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2010/09/07/orcid-as-unique-author-identifier-what-is-it-good-for-and-should-we-worry-or-be-happy/">ORCID</ext-link>
    initiative is probably the best tool to overcome this limitation,
    especially when data from several reference managers have to be
    integrated.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><bold><bold>Article disambiguation</bold></bold>. Multiple copies
    of the same reference are common in reference manager databases. The
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101016090754/http://dx.doi.org/">DOI</ext-link>
    can solve this problem for those publications that have a DOI, but
    consequent use of the DOI by journals, citation databases and
    reference managers has yet to become standard practice.</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>ReaderMeter is visually pleasing and fun to use. And the data are
also provided in JSON format, which allows integration into other web
pages, e.g. the researcher’s home page.</p>
