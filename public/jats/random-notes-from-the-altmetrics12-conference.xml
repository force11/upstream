<p>Last week I attended the

workshop in Chicago. You can read all 11 abstracts
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://altmetrics.org/altmetrics12/program/">here</ext-link>,
and the conference had good Twitter coverage (using the hashtag

at least until Twitter had a total blackout around 12 PM our time.</p>
<p>All but two presenters used slides – I have uploaded

<p>altmetrics12 was one of the best conferences that I have attended
recently. The intensity of the discussions was palpable. My only regrets
are that there wasn’t more time for discussions, but many of us convened
in the bar afterwards.</p>
<p>We were off to a very strong start with two excellent keynote
presentations by Johann Bollen ( Altmetrics: from usage data to social
media) and Gregg Gordon
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://ssrnblog.com/2012/05/18/alternative-is-the-new-grey/">Alternative
is the new Grey</ext-link>). Johann emphasized why it is both important
and fascinating to study how science is actually working. He stressed
that science is a gift economy, where the currency is acknowledgement of
influence in the form of citations. He sees two major problems with the
present citation-based analysis of scientific impact: a) data and b) the
metrics. Citation data are very domain specific (with very different
citation practices in different disciplines), and delayed (several years
after publication of the research they are citing). The problem with
current citation-based metrics is that they ignore the network effect in
science. Johann then went on to explain the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://mesur.informatics.indiana.edu/">MESUR</ext-link>
project, which studies the patterns of scientific activity on a very
large scale (1 billion usage events, 500 million citations, 50 million
papers).</p>

<p>Johann then briefly explained the results of another
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006022">2009
PLoS ONE paper</ext-link> where he analyzed 39 metrics with principal
component analysis. He found two major components in the metrics
analysis: counting vs. social influence and fast vs. slow.</p>

<p>Johann then told the interesting story behind a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3003">2010
paper</ext-link> where he showed that <bold>Twitter mood can predict the
stock market</bold>. The paper was rejected by all publishers and was
finally published on ArXiV in October 2010. It immediately became very
popular in terms of downloads and media attention (and was eventually
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2010.12.007">published</ext-link>
in the <italic>Journal of Computational Science</italic> in March
2011).</p>
<p>Gregg Gordon has summarized his keynote in a May
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://ssrnblog.com/2012/05/18/alternative-is-the-new-grey/">blogpost</ext-link>,
so I will focus on a few highlights. Gregg Gordon runs the Social
Science Research Network
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://ssrn.com/">SSRN</ext-link>),
a leading resource for sharing social sciences research. Gregg thinks
that altmetrics can provide the compass to navigate the map of science
described earlier. He told us some very interesting anecdotes of users
trying to game SSRN by inflating their download counts (e.g. “downloads
for donuts”), and mentioned a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1346397">research
paper</ext-link>analyzing gaming at SSRN. Download counts are apparently
taken very seriously by SSRN authors and are also used for hiring
decisions. SSRN not only has written software to protect against gaming,
but also has a person constantly looking over these numbers (Gregg feels
that computer algorithms alone are not enough).</p>
<p>The two keynotes were followed by 11 short (10-15 minute)
presentations, including two presentations about the PLoS
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/">Article-Level

mechanisms</ext-link> and I emphasized the importance of

<p>After the lunch break (and some interesting discussions) we continued
with demos of various altmetrics applications and users, including

<p>In the last our and a half we split up into several smaller group to
discuss issues relevant for altmetrics. I was in the
<bold>standards</bold> group and we all agreed that it is too early to
sep up rigid standards for this evolving field, but not too early to
start the discussion. The two standards experts in our group (Todd
Carpenter from
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://www.niso.org/home/">NISO</ext-link>
and David Baker from
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528073512/http://casrai.org/">CASRAI</ext-link>)
were of course very helpful with the discussion in our group. In the
closing group discussion the breakout groups reported their major
discussion points (which will hopefully be written up by someone). We
also learned that the NIH is considering changing the Biosketch format
for CVs and is looking for input via a
