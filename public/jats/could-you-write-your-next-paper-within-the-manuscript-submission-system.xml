about web-based writing tools. I believe that these tools are
<italic><italic>almost</italic></italic> there and someone has to put
the pieces together to make them work for writing a scientific
paper.</p>

Manager</ext-link> by Aries Systems are among the most popular web-based
online submission systems. From a technical point of view, it would make
a lot of sense if these submission systems are extended to also cover
the paper writing process. The major advantage of web-based systems – in
contrast to writing your paper in a traditional word processor such as
Microsoft Word – is collaboration. And the actual paper submission
becomes much easier both for the author and the publisher if the paper
is already in the submission system. This could also streamline the
peer-review process, as reviewers could (anonymously) write their
comments directly into the online text.</p>
<p>An online paper writing tool could also make business sense. I
believe that a large number of authors would consider such a system even
with a fee of $25-50 per paper. This could generate enough revenue to
cover the development and maintenance costs of such a system.</p>
