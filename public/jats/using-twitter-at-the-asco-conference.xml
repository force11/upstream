<p>Last week I attended the annual meeting of the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://www.asco.org/">American
Society of Clinical Oncology</ext-link> (ASCO) in Chicago. For my work
it is the most important scientific meeting of the year, and it is also
by far the biggest with more than 30.000 participants.</p>

<p>Blogging is a great way to
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/01/17/scienceonline2010-i-wish-i-was-there">report
from conferences</ext-link>, and for me
<italic><italic>FriendFeed</italic></italic> is the best microblogging
tool to do that. Its use at the 2008 ISMB conference was nicely
described in a <italic><italic>PLoS Comp Biol</italic></italic> paper
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263">doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000263</ext-link>)
by Neil Saunders et al. Unfortunately it seems as if the use of
FriendFeed is declining at every online science conference I go to, as
everybody seems to be switching to
<italic><italic>Twitter</italic></italic>. At the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://bibcamp.wordpress.com/">BibCamp</ext-link>
that we organized in May we didn't even bother trying FriendFeed (or
similar microbloging tools such as Google Buzz, ScienceFeed,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://hotpotato.com/">Hot
Potato</ext-link>,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://www.snapgroups.com/">Snapgroups</ext-link>
or Google Wave).</p>
<p>My main problem with using Twitter at conferences is that it is
difficult to connect all tweets talking about a particular session
together. General hashtags like
<italic><italic>#asco10</italic></italic> are not a solution for
conferences with several thousand tweets. The ASCO conference organizers
asked us to use two
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://www.asco.org/ascov2/MyASCO/Twitter">special
hash tags</ext-link> for some sessions, but it seemed as if almost
nobody was using them. I would not be surprised if someone invents (or
has already done so) a nice service that connects tweets to conference
sessions.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming of Twitter is the lack of automatic long-term
archiving. Therefore
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://www.twitter.com/RMEOncology">@RMEOncology</ext-link>
created a Twapper Keeper that was
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://twapperkeeper.com/hashtag/asco10">used
to archive</ext-link> the about 4500 tweets with the
<italic><italic>#asco10</italic></italic> hashtag. You can do
interesting things with such an archive, Cornelius Puschmann did an
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://wisspub.net/2010/05/11/bibcamp-auswertung/">analysis</ext-link>
of the Twitter activity at our recent
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://blogs.nature.com/mfenner/2010/05/11/action-points">BibCamp</ext-link>
using the R statistical software.</p>
<p>On the second conference day we were invited by the ASCO organizers
to a tweetup. We were twice as many people compared to the tweetup at
last year's ASCO (including one familiar face,
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://www.twitter.com/MaverickNY">@MaverickNY</ext-link>).
We had an interesting discussion for about an hour. The most important
message for me: we were encouraged to freely tweet about the sessions,
restricted only by common sense and not a particular policy. A large
meeting like ASCO with a lot of press coverage and videotaping of most
sessions obviously has it easier to allow widespread Twitter use than a
smaller meeting like the Cold Spring Harbor Biology of Genomes meeting.
The discussions at that meeting in May were nicely covered by
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2010/05/what_a_difference_a_year_makes.php">Daniel
MacArthur</ext-link> and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630144308/http://embargowatch.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/can-you-tweet-from-cold-spring-harbor-laboratory-meetings/">Ivan
Oransky</ext-link>.</p>
<p>ASCO was also the first conference that I attended with an iPad. We
had free WiFi (that worked in most places) and the iPad was great to
write Tweets, look through the PDF of the sessions and posters I wanted
to see (created back home), and to keep in touch via email and Skype.
The only caveat: adding links to Tweets was difficult without
multitasking â€“ although this should become easier with the soon to be
released iOS 4.</p>
<p>I did not like all Tweets about the conference. Twitter was obviously
also used as a marketing tool. Although there is nothing wrong with
that, some pharma companies felt it necessary to tweet exactly the same
message again and again. I would have like more tweets reporting key
findings from the sessions and/or adding comments or interesting links
(e.g. with background information). But I'm optimistic that Twitter
coverage at ASCO11 will be even better, and that by ASCO12 Twitter will
be as mainstream and popular as email was at ASCO10.</p>
