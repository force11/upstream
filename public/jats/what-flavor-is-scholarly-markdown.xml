<p>One important outcome of the recent
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/workshop">Markdown
for Science</ext-link> workshop was an overall agreement that all the
different implementations (or flavors) of markdown that currently exist
are a big problem for the adoption of Scholarly Markdown and that we
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/What-is-Markdown">need</ext-link>:</p>
<p specific-use="wrapper">
  <disp-quote>
    <p>A reference implementation with documentation and tests</p>
  </disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As described by Karthik Ram
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/workshop">31
flavors is great for ice cream but not markdown</ext-link>),
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://martinfenner.ghost.io/2013/06/21/what-flavor-is-scholarly-markdown/@flavor">me</ext-link>
and
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/10/the-future-of-markdown.html">others</ext-link>,
there is really a large number of markdown implementations to choose
from, including</p>
<list list-type="bullet">

<p>These different flavors all serve their needs, but for Markdown to
take off in the relatively small scholarly community it would be very
helpful to come up with a reference implementation. But how do we get to
that point?</p>
<list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
    <p>Think about the features we need for Scholarly Markdown and make
    this the reference implementation?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Organize a working group or committee that decides what is
    Scholarly Markdown?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Pick the Markdown flavor with the best developer support?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>Figure out what markdown flavor has the widest support by tools
    relevant for scholars?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p>See what markdown flavor most scholars are currently using?</p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>I think as a starting point, and until we come up with something
better, #5 makes the most sense. The number of markdown users among
scholars is still small, but my guess would be that Pandoc is currently
the most popular Markdown flavor among scholars. This blog uses Pandoc
and the static site generator
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</ext-link>,
and is hosted on
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pages.github.com/">Github
Pages</ext-link> - for the source code use the link in the footer.
Please tell me in the comments what you are using (Markdown flavor and
tools), and whether I am correct with my wild guess regarding Pandoc.
And make sure your preferred tool is listed in the
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/Tools-to-support-your-markdown-authoring">Tools
to spport your markdown authoring</ext-link> wiki page.</p>
<p>A reference Markdown document is also very helpful to move forward,
as we can see what outputs in HTML, PDF (or other formats) our specific
Markdown tools produce, and how they differ. This reference document
should include citations, tables, figures, and other features typical
for scholarly content. Ideally this is a paper written in Markdown and
accepted for publication - proving the concept -, or it can be a
published paper transformed into markdown, e.g. a paper by
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.elifesciences.org/elife-now-supports-content-negotiation/">eLife</ext-link>.
Feel free to suggest a paper in the comments.</p>
<p>The idea of tests that came up in the Markdown workshop is also
great. Ideally we have a set of tests that we (or someone else, e.g. a
publisher) can run to make sure that the markdown in the document
conforms with the reference implementation. This could also include
basic checks for required metadata (title, author, publication date,
etc.), and could optionally validate the citations as well.</p>
