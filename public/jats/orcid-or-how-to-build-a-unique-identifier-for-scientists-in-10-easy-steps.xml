  Thorisson</ext-link> in May 2009 discussed these issues in much more
  detail. One of several articles talking about the problem of
  disambiguation of author names (especially Asian author names)
  appeared in <italic><italic>Nature News</italic></italic> in
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/451766a">February

  emphasized that a unique identifier for researchers will be especially
  valuable to track scientific contributions that are not related to
  authoring a paper. Phil Bourne and J. Lynne Fink also wrote about this
  in PLoS Computational Biology in December 2008:
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000247">I

  tried to solve this problem, but it is not possible to link the
  researcher identities in the many systems.</p>

  latter is available as

  He emphasized that ORCID is about <italic><italic>Knowledge
  Discovery</italic></italic> and not <italic><italic>Access
  Control</italic></italic>, and explained the terminology for
  <italic><italic>subject</italic></italic>,
  <italic><italic>identifier</italic></italic>,
  <italic><italic>profile</italic></italic>,
  <italic><italic>persona</italic></italic> and
  <italic><italic>credential</italic></italic>. <italic><italic>Access
  Control</italic></italic> is a related problem that is sometimes mixed
  in, but there is no requirement that a unique researcher identifier
  also has to provide secure access via whatever mechanism
  (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://openid.net/">Open

  on the ORCID homepage</ext-link> and include publishers, funders,
  universities, organizations and software companies. A number of
  important stakeholders are already part of the initiative, support by
  more funders (besides the Wellcome Trust) and software companies
  (particularly those that build reference managers or social networking
  sites for scientists) would be great. Probably the biggest name not on
  the list is the U.S. National Library of Medicine that runs the
  <italic><italic>PubMed</italic></italic> database of biomedical
  literature (the ORCID members Wellcome Trust and British Library are
  involved in UK PubMed Central).</p>

<sec id="4-make-decisions-about-the-general-design-of-the-system">
  <title>4. Make decisions about the general design of the
  system</title>
  <p>Some of the design decisions obviously are not set in stone at this
  stage. One continuing discussion is <italic><italic>centralized vs.
  federated</italic></italic>, and it looks like ORCID will be a
  centralized system similar to the DOI. Geoff Bilder has some
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder">good
  arguments</ext-link> for a centralized system. Another recurring theme
  is <italic><italic>how much control an individual researcher
  has</italic></italic> over his ORCID record. Although external
  assertion from publishers or funders will certainly be part of ORCID,
  the individual researcher will have an important role, not only
  because of privacy concerns, but also because this is the easiest way
  to fix errors that even the best automated algorithms for author
  assignment will produce. And it looks as if ORCID will be an
  extensible system that will for example allow publishers or social
  networking sites to add functionality they require. The discussion at
  the STM Innovations meeting in early December touches some of these
  issues and is

</sec>
<sec id="6-build-on-available-tools">

  <p>ORCID will be based on the ResearcherID software from Thomson
  Reuters. From what I’ve seen, the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://openid.net/">Open
  ID</ext-link> system will not be a central part of ORCID. But ORCID
  certainly will be designed to work together with Open ID and other
  authentication mechanisms. I don’t know what Elsevier and the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://www.stm-assoc.org/2009_12_04_Innovations_Weertman_Taking_the_guesswork_out_of_author_searching.pdf">Scopus

</sec>
<sec id="7-form-an-independent-organization">
  <title>7. Form an independent organization</title>
  <p>In order to be adopted widely, ORCID must be run by an independent
  organization, and not by a single publisher, software company,
  research organization or funder. With the experience of
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/02/17/interview-with-geoffrey-bilder">running
  the DOI system</ext-link> to identify digital objects such as
  scientific papers, CrossRef would be one obvious candidate, but the
  ORCID founding members have yet to decide on that.</p>

  <p>Starting and maintaining ORCID will obviously cost money. In my

  about author identifiers back in April 2009</ext-link>, the opinions
  were split about who should pay for this. Journal publishers and
  database maintainers (referring to such databases as PubMed, Scopus or
  Web of Science) were the two most common answers. ORCID will make it
  easier for funding agencies to evaluate scientists and they might
  therefore also contribute to the system. Individual researchers
  hopefully will not have to pay for any of this, but their input in
  time is obviously required.</p>

  in December was a good start to promote ORCID to a wider audience. A
  unique identifier for scientists will only become accepted if widely
  used. That’s why it is important that publishers and funders quickly
  adopt this service. Software companies that build interesting tools
  around ORCID are also critical, e.g. integration of ORCID into
  manuscript submission systems (including the use of ORCID for the peer
  reviewers) and social networking sites (including of course Nature
  Network). My experience with the DOI for papers (e.g. the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151003022831/http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/10/11/thoughts-on-the-pubmed-redesign">limited
  support in PubMed</ext-link>) tells me that adoption of ORCID will be
  a long process.</p>
