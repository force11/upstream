<p>One of the challenges of collecting metrics for scholarly outputs is
persistent identifiers. For journal articles the Digital Object
Identifier (DOI) has become the de-facto standard, other popular
identifiers are the pmid from PubMed, the identifiers used by Scopus and
Web of Science, and the arxiv ID for ArXiV preprints.</p>
<p>For other research outputs the picture is less clear. DOIs are also
used for datasets, but so are many other identifiers, in particular in
the life sciences.</p>
<p>To collect metrics for research outputs, the requirements are
slightly different. We need identifiers understood by the services
collecting the metrics, not by the data repository or other service that
is holding the research output (the only exception is usage stats, which
are generated locally). For many services, in particular social media
such as Facebook, Twitter or Reddit, the primary identifier for a
resource is a URL. This means that we should have one or more URLs for
every research output where we want to track the metrics - typically the
publisher or data repository landing page. Since URLs can be messy,
Google, Facebook and others have come up with the concept of a
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.de/2009/02/specify-your-canonical.html">canonical
URL</ext-link>, and some care should go into constructing proper
canonical URLs (see
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/10/13/broken-dois/">this
blog post</ext-link> for examples of what can go wrong).</p>
<p>The
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.knowledge-exchange.info/Default.aspx?ID=462">Den
Haag Manifesto</ext-link> is the result of a <bold><bold>Knowledge
Exchange</bold></bold> workshop held in June 2011 and tries to bring
Persistent Identifiers and Linked Open Data together. The first
principle is very much in line with what I said above:</p>
<p specific-use="wrapper">
  <disp-quote>
    <p>Make sure PIDs can be referred to as HTTP URIâ€™s, including
    support for content negotiation.</p>
  </disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Or, to put this differently: URLs are good enough to start collecting
metrics for scholarly outputs. Scientific software is a good example
where persistent identifiers are not commonly used (despite efforts such
as
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/">this
one</ext-link>), but we can still collect many meaningful metrics using
the repository URL (and the open source software
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto">lagotto</ext-link>):</p>

  <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/images/software.lagotto.io.png" xlink:title="" />
</fig>
<p>The last three rows are citations in the scholarly literature found
via fulltext search of BioMed Central, Europe PMC and PLOS. URLs (in
contrast to persistent identifiers represented as strings and/or
numbers) are easy to find, the main limitation is not so much using a
URL rather than a DOI, but that scientific software typically is
mentioned in the text without appearing in the reference list. This
makes it hard to impossible to find articles mentioning the software
that are not open access, which unfortunately is still the majority of
them.</p>
<p>We are of course also tracking the discussion of the software in
social media, and are collecting the number of stars and forks in Github
and Bitbucket. Overall there is quite a lot of activity, here are some
examples:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
    <p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://software.lagotto.io/works/url/https://github.com/najoshi/sickle">Windowed
    Adaptive Trimming for fastq files using quality</ext-link></p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/lh3/wgsim">Reads
    simulator</ext-link></p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
    <p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://software.lagotto.io/works/url/https://github.com/lh3/seqtk">Toolkit
    for processing sequences in FASTA/Q formats</ext-link></p>
  </list-item>
</list>
<p>All three software repos have been cited in the scholarly literature
at least ten times. What is missing is infrastructure that tracks the
citations of scientific software, so that we can give proper scientific
credit to the authors of the software, and can discover other research
projects using the same tools.
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://software.lagotto.io/">software.lagotto.io</ext-link>
uses a list of software repos collected by Jure Triglav for
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sciencetoolbox.org/">ScienceToolbox</ext-link>,
and a scientific software index is indeed one of the important missing
pieces.</p>
